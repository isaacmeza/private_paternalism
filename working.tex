We want to claim that for all increasing utility functions $u(\cdot)$:
\begin{align}
\label{fosd}
    \mathbb{E}_{sq}(u(FC))\geq \mathbb{E}_{fee}(u(FC))
\end{align}
as the FC is seen as a `bad'. It can be proven that relation (\ref{fosd}) is equivalent to 
\[F_{sq}(FC)\leq F_{fee}(FC)\]
where $F$ is the distribution function.

\begin{theorem}
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item For every weakly decreasing utility function $u$: $E_{sq}(u(FC))\leq E_{fee}(u(FC))$
    \item $F_{sq}(FC)\leq F_{fee}(FC)$ 
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} \;

[$(a)\Longrightarrow (b)$] Suppose  $(b)$ does not hold. So there exists $FC^*$ such that $F_{sq}(FC^*)>F_{fee}(FC^*)$, Define $u:=\mathds{1}_{FC\leq FC^*}$. Then
\[E_{sq}(u(FC)) = \int u(FC)dF_{sq} = F_{sq}(FC^*)>F_{fee}(FC^*)= \int u(FC)dF_{fee} =E_{fee}(u(FC))\]
which contradicts $(a)$.\\

[$(a)\Longleftarrow (b)$] On the other hand for $u$ weakly decreasing,

\[\int u(y(FC))dF_{sq}(y(FC)) = \int u(y(FC))dF_{fee}(FC) \leq \int u(FC)dF_{fee}(FC)\]
with $y(FC) = F_{sq}^{-1}F_{fee}(FC)$.
\end{proof}

Note the proof was done in the case of absolutely continuous and strictly increasing distribution functions $F_{sq}$ and $F_{fee}$.



\begin{theorem}
Let $F$ and $G$ be the cumulative distributions of two alternative log-normal prospects. The following are equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item For every weakly decreasing utility function $u$: $E_{F}(u(FC))\leq E_G(u(FC))$
    \item $E_F \log(FC)\geq E_G\log(FC)$ and $Var_F \log(FC)= Var_G\log(FC)$
\end{enumerate}

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
See Theorem 4 in \cite{lognormal_dominance}.
\end{proof}



Consider a two period model. The agent chooses to 

A linear model is sufficient to highlight the basic mechanism, and provides a reasonable approximation for small stakes


In the two period model, there is only one decision: whether the agent saves or not. 


\begin{prop}
Absent shocks in the first period, recovery is realized for sufficiently low probability of income shocks, i.e. when
\[\lambda\leq \frac{\beta b-p+(1-\beta)+D}{\beta(b-p)} =: \lambda_{max}\]
\end{prop}


\begin{cor}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $\frac{\partial \lambda_{max}}{\partial \beta}>0 $ : Probability of recovery in neoclassical individuals ($\beta = 1$) is higher than in present bias individuals.
    \item $\frac{\partial \lambda_{max}}{\partial D}>0 $ : In present bias individuals, the probability of recovery is higher in the Fee-Forcing ($D>0$) contract.  
\end{enumerate}
\end{cor}
