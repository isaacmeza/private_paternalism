\subsection{Censoring} \label{App_censoring}


Some loans in our sample are ``censored'' in that they continue beyond our observation period.  For these loans, we do not know whether the borrower ultimately defaulted or recovered her pawn.   We have also shown that one effect of the forcing arm is to accelerate repayment, meaning that it is less likely for loans in this arm to be censored.  This issue is illustrated in Figure \ref{survival_graph}, which shows the CDF of loan completion (either default or recovery in Panel (a)) and loan recovery (Panel (b)) by the number of days since first pawn.  Two features of these graphs are salient for our analysis.  The first is the extent to which loan outcomes are observed more quickly in the mandatory commitment arm.  This is primarily due to the substantially higher rate of repayment of Mandatory Commitment loans at 120 days (15 pp higher than the other arms).  The second is the very low rate at which loans are recovered in any arm after 120 days.  In the 180-320 day window loans are largely dormant, suggesting that many of the censored loans will in fact end in default.

The confluence of censoring and a treatment effect on censoring is potentially problematic from an experimental point of view.  The approach taken in the headline results is a conservative one in that it inherently assumes that all of the loans outstanding at the end of the observation window will be repaid, making it so that the acceleration of payment observed in the Mandatory arm does not translate mechanically into the that treatment decreasing default.  Nonetheless, to be certain that this issue is not driving our results we conduct a bounding exercise to understand how large the effects of this problem can possibly be.  

One way of considering the effect that this issue could have on our results is to make extreme assumptions about the outcome of these loans in the treatment and control so as to bound the possible influence of censoring. In Table \ref{bounding_censoring} we compare the Mandatory and Control arms, bounding the censoring issue by reversing assumptions about the outcome of censored loans in the treatment versus the control.   Panel B provides the lower bound for the treatment effect (closest to zero) by assuming censored control loans are always repaid and treatment loans never are; even in this lower-bound case the treatment effect is cost-reducing and significant at the 1\% significance level and indeed the magnitude of this lower bound estimate is only 6\% closer to zero than our headline result.   Panel C estimates the upper bound by making the reverse assumption.  Comfortingly, even with these extreme assumptions the significance on the main treatment effects never flips and treatment effects on financial cost and interests payments remain negative and significant in all scenarios.  So there appears to be no scope for the censoring issue to overturn our main results. 

Finally, Panel E of this table conducts a logit prediction model that uses all of the available information on loans that were completed to predict the outcome of loans that were not.  This is a ``best guess'' of the outcome on censored loans.  Using this prediction, we replicate the main experimental results and find that the treatment effect on financial cost increases from -204 (main results) to -264 (censored loans predicted), and the APR from -11\% to -17\%.  Hence, while the censoring issue does have an effect on the magnitude of our estimated treatment effects, these  checks confirm that (a) the core results are fully robust to censoring, and (b) the headline approach that we take to the issue is conservative and likely understates the true magnitude of impacts.

\begin{center}
\resizebox{0.75\textwidth}{!}{
\footnotesize{\input{./Tables/censoring_imp.tex}}
}
\end{center}
 
\end{table}
 \footnotesize{ Given the censored loans, i.e. loans that have not finished by the end of the observation period, we estimate `a la Manski' bounds for these loans, meaning that we impute all loans to either \emph{default}$=1$ or \emph{recovery}$=0$ depending on the treatment arm. Different panels perform different imputations for the censored loans for all possible combinations for the imputation, and computes the ATE for the same outcomes of Table \ref{main_impact_table}. Panel A, for instance, assumes that all outstanding loans are fully payed. Panel B is the most conservative imputation since it assumes all outstanding loans in the control arm are payed, while all the outstanding loans in the mandatory commitment arm default. Panel C, on the other hand, is the most optimistic scenario opposite to that of Panel B. Panel D assumes all remaining loans default. The last panel makes the imputation to the censored loans according to the best prediction using a piecewise lasso logit model for default. In concrete, we build two logit models with lasso regularization, depending whether the loan duration is less than 220 days (two cycles) or more than 220 days. For prediction we use the former whenever the last recorded payment was done within 220 days, and the latter otherwise. Both models includes loan characteristics (loan size, branch), and payment behavior (loan duration so far, days to first payment, \% of first payment, \% of payments at 30, 60, 90, and 105 days, and \% of interest payed at 105 days), but the latter model also includes \% of payments at 150, 180, and 210 days. This predictive model achieves an accuracy rate of 92\% both in-sample and out-of-sample.
 Note that in all panels we maintain significant results for Financial Cost as dependent variable, while only in the most conservative scenario (Panel B) we lose significance for the APR outcome. }

\subsection{Repawning}

We now estimate equation \ref{basic_reg} with Different dependent variables.  In column 1, the dependent variable indicates, for each borrower in the experiment, whether he/she pawned again after the first loan in the
experiment (up to the end period of our data set 338 days after the experiment began). The result is that the likelihood of repeat business increases by 6.7\%.  While this appears to be \emph{prima facie} evidence of greater satisfaction among borrowers in the mandatory arm, the interpretation is complicated by the fact that monthly payments may themselves trigger more borrowing to pay them. Note that from the lender's perspective, why repeat pawning happens may not be as important as the fact that it happens. Illiquidity does not seem to drive this result, given that the effect on re-pawning comes after 90 days (during the period of contract demanded payments) and not before  (see columns 2 and 3). Column 4 only considers new loans that use different collateral from that of the initial one. We do this to foreclose the explanation that those in the Mandatory arm, being more liquidity-constrained, return to pawn a second pawn to be able to pay the monthly payments of their first loan. However, we cannot reject a zero effect on pawning a different collateral. Column 5 focuses on the (endogenous) subsample of those recovering their pawn in both arms of the experiment. This means that \textit{both} arms have recovered their pawn and could re-pawn if they so wish, and also that the liquidity demands from the monthly contract are \textit{no longer} there as the contract has been closed.  We find that the difference between the Forcing contract and the status quo is even larger in this subsample, with the former having 11pp higher likelihood of being a repeat client during our sample period.

\section{ Alternative explanations}
\subsection{Learning}

\textcolor{red}{The experiment was not designed to study learning, and the short time frame and sample size limit what we can say.} Table \ref{learning_table} presents information about borrowers' \emph{future} pawning behavior as a function of treatment assignment. Column (1) considers the 228 clients who returned only a second time to pawn again at a day/branch that was randomly assigned to the choice arm. Each of the two rows in this column presents a difference of mean commitment take-up rates, and associated standard error. The first row compares those who were \emph{initially} assigned to mandatory structure against those where were assigned to control; the second row compares those who were initially assigned to the choice arm to those who were assigned to the other two arms. In each case, there is no statistically discernible difference in the rates of commitment take-up. Granted, this is a selected sample because the decision to pawn again is potentially endogenous to the initial treatment allocation. For this reason, Column (2) considers the full sample of 4441 borrowers by re-defining the outcome variable to be an indicator for returning to pawn again at a branch/day when commitment was offered \emph{and} choosing commitment. This composite outcome variable is not subject to the sample selection problem (although it is directly driven by the decision to repeat borrow). The comparison in the two rows remains the same: mandatory structure versus control in row one and choice versus mandatory arms in row two. Again, there is no statistically discernible difference in commitment take-up rates in either row. While these exercises cannot completely exclude the possibility that learning plays a role, they provide no indication that the lack of voluntary compliance is simply a matter of inexperience with commitment.



\begin{table}[H]
        \caption{Effect of Prior Assignment on Subsequent Choice}
    \label{learning_table}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{\input{./Tables/learning_exp.tex}}
\end{center}
 \footnotesize{Column (1) reports results for the 228 borrowers who returned to pawn again at a day/branch that was randomly assigned to the choice arm, enabling us to observe whether they chose commitment or the status quo contract.
Each row presents a difference in mean commitment take-up rates and associated standard errors.
The first row (ATE) compares borrowers who were initially assigned to mandatory structure against those were assigned to the control condition.
The second row (ITT) compares borrowers who were initially assigned to the choice commitment condition to those who were not.
Whereas column (1) conditions on the (endogenously) selected sample of borrowers who return to pawn again, column (2) considers the full sample by re-defining the ``outcome'' to be an indicator for whether a borrower pawned again on a day when choice was offered \emph{and} chose commitment.}

%This table explores learning by focusing on a subsample of borrowers in the experiment and observing their subsequent behavior. Column 1 conditions the sample on borrowers who (a) pawned during the experiment a subsequent time after being assigned to control, forced commitment or choice (the regressors), and (b) when pawning again they went to a branch day when (randomly) choice was available, thus enabling us to observe if they chose the commitment contract or the status quo.  in this sample it estimates a linear probability model where the dependent variable is equal to one if the borrower chose the commitment contract in that subsequent `choice' occasion and zero otherwise. The regressors are indicators for the treatment arms in their first pawn in the experiment. Column 1 conditions the sample on the (endogenous) event of pawning again. Column 2 does not condition the sample, but instead defined the dependent variable as equal to one \hl{if the borrower pawned subsequently and choice was available that day and chose commitment, and zero otherwise.}

\subsection{Present Bias}\label{App_presentbias}

\noindent \textbf{Present bias.} If the benefits of commitment among non-choosers cannot be explained by standard models of rational choice, the canonical behavioral story would center on time inconsistency.  While commitment is useful to anyone with hyperbolic time preferences, only those who are sophisticated--i.e.\ aware that they are hyperbolic discounters--will demand it.  A large share of ``na\"ive'' hyperbolics in the population--borrowers who are unaware that they are hyperbolic discounters--could therefore drive a large and positive $\text{TUT}$.  Our baseline survey included standard questions about discount rates between today and a month in the future versus discount rates between three and four months in the future.
This allows us to classify borrowers who display more impatience over immediate delays as present biased. This measure of financial hyperbolicity is widely used in survey research, although it is not without problems.\footnote{Our measure is dichotomous, and it is not incentivized. Recent empirical work has shown the superiority of more elaborate measures such as ``convex time budgets'' \citep{andreoni2015measuring} while questioning the interpretation of measures of hyperbolicity that are not based on consumption \citep{andreoni2012estimating, cohen2020measuring}, suggesting that real effort tasks provide a better measure \citep{augenblick2015working}.  Given that we had only a few minutes to interview real pawnshop clients prior to a commercial transaction, our simple measure was a necessary compromise.}   

If we could perfectly measure present bias and sophistication, we could divide the sample into three groups: sophisticated hyperbolics (who chose commitment), time-consistent non-choosers (for whom forcing will not be effective), and na\"{i}ve hyperbolic non-choosers (who will benefit from mandatory structure). %If present bias fully explains the low take-up rate of voluntary commitment, we should find that the TUT for present-biased borrowers  is positive while the TUT for all other borrowers is not.
If present bias fully explains the low take-up rate of voluntary commitment, we should find that the TUT for present-biased borrowers is positive. This is because among the group of non-takers, a comparison of present-biased borrowers against everyone else is a comparison of na\"{i}ve hyperbolics against time-consistent non-choosers. 

The left panel of Figure \ref{tut_beh_partition} carries out a feasible version of this exercise using our survey measure of present bias.
The overall TUT estimate along with a 95\% confidence interval is given in blue.\footnote{For all borrowers who answered our present-bias survey questions.}
The corresponding TUT estimate and confidence interval for present-biased borrowers identified with the survey question is given in green; results for all other borrowers are shown in red.
The overall TUT is a weighted average of the impact in these two sub-groups.  The TUT among the present biased is insignificant and less than half the size of the strongly significant TUT among those who are \textit{not} present biased. Therefore, taking our survey measure of hyperbolicity at face value, we find no indication that present-bias explains our positive estimated TUT.

%\text{ATE}(X_i) \equiv \mathbbm{E}[Y_{i1} - Y_{i0} |X_i] = \mathbbm{E}[Y_{i1} - Y_{i0}] \equiv \text{ATE}
%\]
%for any covariates $X_i$ that vary across $i$. If, on the other hand, $\text{ATE}(X_i)$ can be predicted using some scalar function $\tau(\cdot)$ of $X_i$, then the average treatment effect function is not constant so there must be treatment effect heterogeneity. 
%
%We operationalize this idea using a two-step approach proposed by \cite{chernozhukov2018generic}.  We begin by randomly dividing the participants in the forced arms of the experiment ($Z_i \neq 2$) into two groups: a training set and a test set.
%These sets are constructed to ensure that all observations from a given branch-day cluster are allocated to the same set.
%This avoids inferential problems that could arise from correlated unobservables within clusters.
%In the first step, we apply the generalized random forest approach of \cite{atheygrf} to the training set to estimate two proxy predictors: $\psi(\cdot|\text{Training})$ approximates the untreated potential outcome function, $\mathbbm{E}[Y_{i0}|X_i] = \mathbbm{E}[Y_i|Z_i=0,X_i]$, while  $\tau(\cdot|\text{Training})$, approximates the ATE function
%\[
%\text{ATE}(X_i) = \mathbbm{E}[Y_i|Z_i=1,X_i] - \mathbbm{E}[Y_i|Z_i=0, X_i].
%\]
%The proxy predictors need not be unbiased or even consistent estimators of the functions they aim to approximate: the goal of this exercise is merely to find a scalar function of $X_i$ that \emph{accurately predicts} $\text{ATE}(X_i)$.
%In the second step we fit a linear regression model to data from the training set using regressors constructed from the proxy functions $\psi(\cdot|\text{Training})$ and $\tau(\cdot|\text{Training})$ constructed in the first step. In particular, we estimate 
%\begin{equation}
%Y_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \psi_i + \beta_1 (Z_i - \mathbbm{E}[Z_i]) + \beta_2 (Z_i - \mathbbm{E}[Z_i])(\tau_i - \mathbbm{E}[\tau_i]) + \epsilon_i
%\label{eq:chernreg}
%\end{equation}
%where $\psi_i \equiv \psi(X_i|\text{Training})$ and $\tau_i \equiv \tau(X_i|\text{Training})$.\footnote{This is a slightly simpler regression than the one proposed in equation (3.1) of \cite{chernozhukov2018generic}, which involves propensity score weights. Because the random assignment of $Z$ in our experiment does \emph{not} condition on $X$, the propensity score weights in our case are constant over $X$ and hence drop out.} As shown by \cite{chernozhukov2018generic}, the coefficients $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ from \eqref{eq:chernreg} identify the \emph{best linear predictor} of the conditional ATE based on $\tau(\cdot|\text{Training})$, namely
%\[
%\beta_1 = \mathbbm{E}[\text{ATE}(X_i)] = \text{ATE}, \quad
%\beta_2 = \frac{\text{Cov}[\text{ATE}(X_i), \tau_i]}{\text{Var}(\tau_i)}.
%\]
%If treatment effects are homogeneous we must have $\beta_2 = 0$. Rejecting this hypothesis establishes that $\tau_i$ predicts $\text{ATE}(X_i)$ and hence that $\Delta_i$ varies. 
%Since $\tau_i$ and $\psi_i$ do not depend on the test set, inference for the regression in \eqref{eq:chernreg} is straightforward conditional on the Training/Test split.  
%Our estimate for $\beta_2$ is 2.56 with a one-sided heteroskedasticity-robust (HC3) standard error of 0.43.
%Thus we easily reject the null hypothesis of homogeneous treatment effects.

\section{ Causal Random Forest, CATE, and `mistakes'}\label{app:cate}


To estimate the conditional average treatment effects shown in Figure \ref{heterogeneous_effects}, we use administrative and survey data, and the function \texttt{causal\_forest()} of the \texttt{grf} R package; to estimate conditional TOT and TUT effects we use the \texttt{instrumental\_forest()} function from the same package.
In each case, we use the default parameter values from the \texttt{grf} package with one exception: we increase the number of trees from the default value of 2000 to 5000.
The functions \texttt{causal\_forest()} and \texttt{instrumental\_forest()} implement special cases of the ``generalized random forest'' methods of \cite{atheygrf}.
In broad strokes, these functions combine a large number of regression trees that recursively partition the covariate space to estimate conditional average effects.
% Figure \ref{causal_tree1} illustrates the partition that emerges from one of the trees in our causal forest implementation.
The trees are ``honest'' in that observations used to determine the optimal partition are not used to estimate effects, and vice-versa.
While closely related to more familiar ``regression-tree'' random forests, the generalized random forest approach explicitly targets the parameter of interest--a conditional ATE or IV estimand--when choosing the optimal covariate partition.
\footnote{For more details, see \cite{atheygrf} and the \texttt{grf} documentation: \url{https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/}. When constructing our random forest estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects, we use observations for all borrowers who answered at least \emph{part} of the intake survey.
We impute the median response for the missing values, while also including an indicator whether the variable originally had a missing value. Results are similar if we manually include interactions between the original/imputed variable and an indicator for missingness. This is as expected, given that tree-based methods by their nature ``automatically'' consider interactions of arbitrary orders.}

\section{Testable Implications of the Exclusion Restriction} \label{sec:testing_exclusion}

Let $Y_0 \equiv Y(0,0)$ and $Y_1 \equiv Y(1,1)$ denote the potential outcomes under \emph{mandatory treatment}: $Y_0$ is the potential outcome when assigned to the status quo contract and $Y_1$ when mandated to the structured contract. 
Further let $Y_{0,2} \equiv Y(0,2)$ and $Y_{1,2} \equiv Y(1,2)$ denote the potential outcomes under \emph{free choice of treatment}: $Y_{0,2}$ is the potential outcome when choosing the status quo contract and $Y_{1,2}$ when choosing the commitment contract. 
Using this notation, the exclusion restrictions upon which our TUT and TOT results rely are $Y_0 = Y_{0,2}$ and $Y_1 = Y_{1,2}$.\footnote{While we assume $Y_i(d,z) = Y_i(d)$ in the body of the paper for simplicity, our derivations only rely on these two equalities.}
Without imposing these, Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice}(iii) becomes 
\[
Y = \mathbbm{1}(Z =0) Y_{0} + \mathbbm{1}(Z = 1)  Y_{1}  + \mathbbm{1}(Z = 2) \left[(1 - C) Y_{0,2} + C Y_{1,2} \right]
\]
but parts (i) and (ii) continue to hold.
Accordingly, parts (i)--(iii) of Lemma \ref{lem_randchoice} are unchanged, while parts (iv) and (v) become
\[
\mathbbm{E}(Y|D=0,Z=2) = \mathbbm{E}(Y_{0,2}|C=0), \quad
\mathbbm{E}(Y|D=1,Z=2) = \mathbbm{E}(Y_{0,1}|C=1).
\]
Using these expressions, the testable restrictions we consider here are as follows:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:exclusion_append0}
\mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=0) &= \mathbbm{E}(Y_{0,2}|C=0) \\
\label{eq:exclusion_append1}
\mathbbm{E}(Y_1|C=1) &= \mathbbm{E}(Y_{1,2}|C=1).
\end{align}
Because they refer to different groups of people--choosers versus non-choosers--either of \eqref{eq:exclusion_append0}  and \eqref{eq:exclusion_append1} could hold when the other is violated.
For this reason we consider each in turn.
Our approach is closely related to arguments from \cite{huber_mellace} and \cite{BinaryRegressor}, among others.

Consider first \eqref{eq:exclusion_append0}.
Let $p \equiv \mathbbm{P}(C=1) = \mathbbm{P}(D=1|Z=2)$ denote the share of choosers in the population.
This value is point identified regardless of whether the exclusion restriction holds.
Because $Z$ was randomly assigned, a fraction $p$ of borrowers with $Z=0$ are choosers while the remaining $(1-p)$ are non-choosers.
It follows that, regardless of whether the exclusion restriction holds, the observed distribution of $Y|Z=0$ is a mixture of $Y_0|C=0$ and $Y_0|C=1$ with mixing weights $(1-p)$ and $p$.
This allows us to construct a pair of bounds for $\mathbb{E}(Y_0|C=0)$ as follows.
The non-choosers must lie \emph{somewhere} in the distribution of $Y|Z=0$.
Consider the two most extreme possibilities: they could occupy the bottom $(1-p)\times 100\%$ of the distribution or the top $(1-p)\times 100\%$ of the distribution.
For this reason, computing the average of the \emph{truncated} distribution of $Y|Z=0$, cutting out the top $p\times 100\%$, provides a lower bound for the average of $Y_0$ among non-choosers.
Similarly, cutting out the bottom $p \times 100\%$ provides an upper bound.
Let $y^0_{1-p}$ denote the $(1-p)$ quantile of $Y|Z=0$ and $y^0_{p}$ denote the $p$ quantile of the same distribution.
Using this notation, the bounds are given by
\[
\mathbb{E}\left(Y|Z=0, Y\leq y^0_{1-p}\right)\leq \mathbb{E}(Y_0|C=0) \leq \mathbb{E}\left(Y|Z=0, Y \geq y^0_p\right) 
\]
These bounds do not rely on the exclusion restriction.
Under Equation \ref{eq:exclusion_append0}, however, we know that $\mathbb{E}(Y_0|C=0)=\mathbb{E}(Y|D=0,Z=2)$.
Therefore, if the exclusion restriction for non-choosers holds, we must have
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\left(Y|Z=0, Y\leq y^0_{1-p}\right)\leq \mathbb{E}(Y|D=0,Z=2) \leq \mathbb{E}\left(Y|Z=0, Y \geq y^0_p\right).
\label{eq:testable0}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:testable0} provides a pair of testable implications of \eqref{eq:exclusion_append0}.
If either inequality is violated, then the exclusion restriction for non-choosers fails.
In our experiment, $\widehat{p} = \widehat{\mathbbm{P}}(D=1|Z=2) = 0.11$. For the APR outcome we estimate
\[
\widehat{\mathbbm{E}}(Y_\text{APR}|Z=0,Y_\text{APR}\leq y^0_{0.89}) = 0.48, \quad
\widehat{\mathbbm{E}}(Y_\text{APR}|Z=0, Y_\text{APR}\geq y^0_{0.11}) = 0.62.
\]
Since $\widehat{\mathbbm{E}}(Y_\text{APR}|D=0,Z=2) = 0.58$ falls between these bounds, we find no evidence against the exclusion restriction for non-choosers. 
The same result holds for the financial cost outcome: results available upon request. 
%so we again find no evidence against the exclusion restriction for non-choosers.

We can use an analogous approach to construct testable implications for \ref{eq:exclusion_append1}, yielding 
\begin{equation}
\mathbbm{E}\left(Y|Z=1,Y\leq y^1_{p}\right) \leq \mathbbm{E}(Y|D=1,Z=2) \leq \mathbbm{E}\left(Y|Z=1,Y \geq y^1_{1-p}\right).
\label{eq:testable1}
\end{equation}
where $y^1_p$ and $y^1_{1-p}$ are the $p$ and $1 - p$ quantiles of the distribution of $Y|Z=1$.
If either inequality is violated, then the exclusion restriction from Equation \ref{eq:exclusion_append1} fails.
Again, in our experiment $\widehat{p}=0.11$. For the APR outcome we estimate
\[
\widehat{\mathbbm{E}}(Y|Z=1,Y\leq y^1_{0.11}) = 0.06, \quad
\widehat{\mathbbm{E}}(Y|Z=1,Y\geq y^1_{0.89}) = 1.28
\]
Since $\widehat{\mathbbm{E}}(Y_\text{APR}|D=1,Z=2) = 0.43$ falls between these bounds, we find no evidence against the exclusion restriction for the choosers. 
The same holds for the financial cost outcome: results available upon request.

\section{Estimation and Inference} 
\label{sec:estimation_inference}

\subsection{Regression-based Estimation of TOT, TUT, ASG, ASL, and ASB}

Let $Z_0 \equiv \mathbbm{1}\{Z=0\}$, $Z_1 \equiv \mathbbm{1}\{Z=1\}$, and $Z_2 \equiv \mathbbm{1}\{Z=2\}$.
Under standard regularity conditions, the following proposition shows that an IV regression of $Y$ on an intercept, $Z_1$ and $Z_2 D$ with instruments $(1, Z_0, Z_1)$ provides consistent estimates the ATE and TOT, while an IV regression of $Y$ on an intercept, $-Z_0$ and $-Z_2(1-D)$ with the same instrument set consistently estimates the ATE and TUT effects.

\begin{prop} 
\label{prop:TOTandTUTregs}
Under Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice}, 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
\item $Y = \mathbbm{E}(Y_0) + \text{ATE}\times Z_1 + \text{TOT} \times Z_2 D + U$
\item $Y = \mathbbm{E}(Y_1) + \text{ATE}\times -Z_0 + \text{TUT} \times -Z_2 (1 - D) + V$
\end{enumerate}
where $\mathbbm{E}(U|Z) = \mathbbm{E}(V|Z) = 0$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:TOTandTUTregs}]
For part (i), since $Z_2 D = Z_2 C$ and $(Z_0 + Z_1 + Z_2) = 1$, Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (iii) implies $Y= Y_0 + Z_1 (Y_1 - Y_0) + Z_2D(Y_1 - Y_0)$.
Now define 
\[
U \equiv [Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0)] + Z_1[(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{ATE}] + Z_2 D[(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TOT}].
\]
Since $Z_2 D = Z_2 C$ and $Z$ is independent of $(Y_1, Y_0)$ by Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (i), it follows that $\mathbbm{E}(U|Z) = Z_2 \mathbbm{E}\left[C\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TOT}\right\}|Z\right]$.
Thus, by iterated expectations,
\begin{align*}
\mathbbm{E}\left[C\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TOT}\right\}|Z\right] 
%&=  \mathbbm{P}(C=1|Z) \left[\mathbbm{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|C=1,Z)  - \text{TOT}\right]\\
&= \mathbbm{P}(C=1)\left[\mathbbm{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|C=1) - \text{TOT} \right]=0
\end{align*}
since $Z$ is independent of $(Y_0, Y_1)$ given $C$, an implication of Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (i).

For part (ii), since $Z_2(1 - C)= Z_2(1 - D)$ and $(Z_1 + Z_2) = 1 - Z_0$,  Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (iii) implies $Y= Y_1 - Z_0 (Y_1 - Y_0) - Z_2(1 - D) (Y_1 - Y_0)$.
Define 
\[
V \equiv [Y_1 - \mathbb{E}(Y_1)] - Z_0[(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{ATE}] - Z_2(1 - D)[(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TUT}].
\]
Since $Z_2(1 - D) = Z_2 (1 - C)$ and $Z$ is independent of $(Y_0, Y_1)$ by Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (i),
$\mathbb{E}(V|Z) = -Z_2\mathbb{E}[(1 - C)\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TUT}\right\}|Z]$.
Thus, by iterated expectations,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[(1 - C)\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TUT}\right\}|Z]
%&= \mathbb{P}(C=0|Z)\left[ \mathbb{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|C=0, Z) - \text{TUT}\right]\\
&= \mathbb{P}(C=0|Z) \left[ \mathbb{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|C=0) - \text{TUT}\right] = 0
\end{align*}
since $Z$ is independent of $(Y_0, Y_1)$ given $C$, an implication of Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (i).
\end{proof}

%\begin{prop} 
%\label{prop:TOTreg}
%Under Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice}, $Y = \mathbbm{E}(Y_0) + \text{ATE}\times Z_1 + \text{TOT} \times Z_2 D + U$ where $\mathbbm{E}(U|Z) = 0$.
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{proof}
%By Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (iii),
%$Y= Y_0 + Z_1 (Y_1 - Y_0) + Z_2D(Y_1 - Y_0)$
%%\begin{align*}
%%Y &= Z_0 Y_0 + Z_1 Y_1 + Z_2[(1 - C) Y_0 + CY_1] 
%%= (Z_0 + Z_2)Y_0 + Z_1 Y_1 + Z_2C(Y_1 - Y_0)\\
%%&= (Z_0 + Z_1 + Z_2)Y_0 + Z_1 (Y_1 - Y_0) + Z_2D(Y_1 - Y_0) 
%%= Y_0 + Z_1 (Y_1 - Y_0) + Z_2D(Y_1 - Y_0).
%%\end{align*}
%because $Z_2 D = Z_2 C$ and $(Z_0 + Z_1 + Z_2) = 1$.
%Thus, defining 
%\[
%U \equiv [Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0)] + Z_1[(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{ATE}] + Z_2 D[(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TOT}]
%\]
%by construction we have $Y = \mathbbm{E}(Y_0) + \text{ATE} \times Z_1 + \text{TOT} \times Z_2 D+ U$.
%Since $Z_2 D = Z_2 C$ and $Z$ is independent of $(Y_1, Y_0)$ by Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (i), we have
%\begin{align*}
%\mathbbm{E}(U|Z) 
%%&= [\mathbbm{E}(Y_0|Z) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0)]  + Z_1[\mathbbm{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|Z) - \text{ATE}] +  \mathbbm{E}\left[Z_2 D\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TOT}\right\}|Z\right]\\
%%&= [\mathbbm{E}(Y_0) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0)]  + Z_1[\mathbbm{E}(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{ATE}] + Z_2 \mathbbm{E}\left[C\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TOT}\right\}|Z\right]\\
%&= Z_2 \mathbbm{E}\left[C\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TOT}\right\}|Z\right].
%\end{align*}
%Finally, by iterated expectations
%\begin{align*}
%\mathbbm{E}\left[C\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TOT}\right\}|Z\right] 
%%&=  \mathbbm{P}(C=1|Z) \left[\mathbbm{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|C=1,Z)  - \text{TOT}\right]\\
%&= \mathbbm{P}(C=1)\left[\mathbbm{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|C=1) - \text{TOT} \right]=0
%\end{align*}
%since $Z$ is conditionally independent of $(Y_0, Y_1)$ given $C$, an implication of \ref{assump:randchoice} (i).
%\end{proof}
%
%%The next proposition provides regression-based estimates of the ATE and TUT.
%\begin{prop}
%\label{prop:TUTreg}
%Under Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice}, $Y = \mathbbm{E}(Y_1) + \text{ATE}\times -Z_0 + \text{TUT} \times -Z_2 (1 - D) + V$ where $\mathbb{E}(V|Z) = 0$.
%Thus, an IV regression of $Y$ on an intercept, $-Z_0$ and $-Z_2(1-D)$ with instruments $(1, Z_0, Z_1)$ provides consistent estimates of the ATE and TUT effects.
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{proof}
%By Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (iii),
%$Y= Y_1 - Z_0 (Y_1 - Y_0) - Z_2(1 - D) (Y_1 - Y_0)$
%%\begin{align*}
%%Y %&= Z_0 Y_0 + Z_1 Y_1 + Z_2[(1 - C) Y_0 + CY_1] 
%%&= Z_0 Y_0 + Z_1 Y_1 + Z_2[(1 - C) (Y_0 - Y_1) + Y_1]
%%&= Z_0 Y_0 + (Z_1 + Z_2) Y_1 + Z_2(1 - C) (Y_0 - Y_1) = Z_0 Y_0 + (1 - Z_0) Y_1 + Z_2(1 - D) (Y_0 - Y_1) \\
%%= Y_1 - Z_0 (Y_1 - Y_0) - Z_2(1 - D) (Y_1 - Y_0)
%%\end{align*}
%since $Z_2(1 - C)= Z_2(1 - D)$ and $(Z_1 + Z_2) = 1 - Z_0$.
%Thus, defining 
%\[
%V \equiv [Y_1 - \mathbb{E}(Y_1)] - Z_0[(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{ATE}] - Z_2(1 - D)[(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TUT}]
%\]
%by construction we have $Y = \mathbb{E}(Y_1) + \text{ATE} \times -Z_0 + \text{TUT} \times -Z_2(1 - D) + V$.
%Now, since $Z_2(1 - D) = Z_2 (1 - C)$ and $Z$ is independent of $(Y_0, Y_1)$ by Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (i),
%\begin{align*}
%\mathbb{E}(V|Z) 
%%&= [\mathbb{E}(Y_1|Z) - \mathbb{E}(Y_1)] - Z_0[\mathbb{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|Z) - \text{ATE}] - \mathbb{E}[Z_2(1 - D)\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TUT}\right\}|Z]\\
%%&= [\mathbb{E}(Y_1) - \mathbb{E}(Y_1)] - Z_0[\mathbb{E}(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{ATE}] - Z_2\mathbb{E}[(1 - C)\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TUT}\right\}|Z]\\
%&= -Z_2\mathbb{E}[(1 - C)\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TUT}\right\}|Z].
%\end{align*}
%Finally, by iterated expectations,
%\begin{align*}
%\mathbb{E}[(1 - C)\left\{(Y_1 - Y_0) - \text{TUT}\right\}|Z]
%%&= \mathbb{P}(C=0|Z)\left[ \mathbb{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|C=0, Z) - \text{TUT}\right]\\
%&= \mathbb{P}(C=0|Z) \left[ \mathbb{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|C=0) - \text{TUT}\right] = 0
%\end{align*}
%since $Z$ is independent of $(Y_0, Y_1)$ given $C$, an implication of Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (i).
%\end{proof}

Since $\text{ASG} = \text{TOT} - \text{TUT}$, the preceding proposition provides a consistent estimate of the $\text{ASG}$ effect.
The $\text{ASB}$ effect, $\mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=1) - \mathbb{E}(Y_0|C=0)$, can likewise be estimated by taking the difference of coefficients across two linear IV regressions with \emph{no intercept} and instrument sets $(Z_0, Z_2)$, as shown in the following proposition.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:ASBreg}
Under Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $(1 - D) Y = \mathbbm{E}(Y_{0}) \times Z_0 + \mathbbm{E}(Y_{0}|C=0) \times (1 - D)Z_2 + U_{0}$
    \item  $(1 - D) Y = \mathbbm{E}(Y_{0}) \times(Z_0 + Z_2) + \mathbbm{E}(Y_{0}|C=1)\times -DZ_2 + U_{1}$
\end{enumerate}
where $\mathbbm{E}(U_0|Z) = \mathbbm{E}(U_1|Z) = 0$.
%Thus, an IV regression of $(1 - D)Y$ on $Z_0$ and $(1 - D)Z_2$ with instruments $(Z_0, Z_2)$ and no intercept consistently estimates $\mathbb{E}(Y_0)$ and $\mathbb{E}(Y_0|C=0)$. 
%Similarly, an IV regression of $(1 - D)Y$ on $(Z_0 + Z_2)$ and $-DZ_2$ with instruments $(Z_0, Z_2)$ and no intercept consistently estimates $\mathbb{E}(Y_0)$ and $\mathbb{E}(Y_0|C=1)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (ii) implies $(1 - D) = Z_0 + Z_2(1 - C)$. Hence, 
\begin{align*}
(1 - D)Y 
%&=  [Z_0 + Z_2 (1 - C)]\left\{Z_0 Y_0 + Z_1 Y_1 + Z_2[(1 - C) Y_0 + CY_1]\right\}\\
&= Z_0 Y_0 + Z_2 (1 - C) [(1 - C) Y_0 + C Y_1] = Z_0 Y_0 + Z_2 (1 - C) Y_0
\end{align*}
by Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (iii), since $Z_j^2 = Z_j$ for any $j$ and $Z_j Z_k = 0$ for any $j \neq k$ and, similarly, $(1 - C)^2 = (1 - C)$ and $C (1 - C) = 0$.
Therefore, since $Z_2 (1 - C) = Z_2 (1 - D)$,
\[
(1 - D)Y = Z_0 Y_0 + Z_2 (1 - D) Y_0, \quad
(1 - D)Y = (Z_0 + Z_2) Y_0 + (-DZ_2) Y_0. 
\]
Now, define 
\begin{align*}
U_0 &\equiv Z_0 [Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0)] + Z_2(1 - D)[Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=0)]\\
U_1 &\equiv (Z_0 + Z_2)[Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0)] + (-Z_2 D)[Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=1)].
\end{align*}
%by construction, we have
%\begin{align*}
%Y &= \mathbbm{E}(Y_0) \times Z_0 + \mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=0) \times Z_2(1 - D) + U_0\\
%Y &= \mathbbm{E}(Y_0) \times (Z_0 + Z_2)+ \mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=1) (-Z_2D) + U_1.
%\end{align*}
Since $Z_2(1-D) = Z_2(1 - C)$, and $Z$ is independent of $Y_0$,  
\begin{align*}
\mathbbm{E}(U_0|Z) 
%&= Z_0[\mathbbm{E}(Y_0|Z) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0)] + Z_2\mathbbm{E}\{(1 - C) [Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=0) |Z\}\\
&= Z_2 \mathbbm{E}[Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=0) | C = 0, Z] = 0
\end{align*}
by iterated expectations and the fact that $Z$ is conditionally independent of $Y_0$ given $C$. 
Since $Z_2 D = Z_2 C$, a nearly identical argument gives
\begin{align*}
\mathbbm{E}(U_1|Z) 
%&= (Z_0 + Z_2)[Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0|Z)] -Z_2\mathbbm{E}\{C [Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=1) |Z\}\\
&= -Z_2 \mathbbm{E}[Y_0 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=0) | C = 1, Z] = 0. \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}


The final result in this section implies that the $\text{ASL}$ effect, $\mathbbm{E}(Y_1|C=1) - \mathbb{E}(Y_1|C=0)$, can be estimated as the difference of coefficients across two linear IV regressions with \emph{no intercept} and instrument set $(Z_1, Z_2)$.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:ASLreg}
Under Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice},
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $D Y = \mathbbm{E}(Y_{1}) \times(Z_1 + Z_2) + \mathbbm{E}(Y_{1}|C=0)\times (D - 1)Z_2 + V_{0}$
\item  $D Y = \mathbbm{E}(Y_{1}) \times Z_1 + \mathbbm{E}(Y_{1}|C=1)\times D Z_2+ V_{1}$
\end{enumerate}
where $\mathbbm{E}(V_0|Z) = \mathbbm{E}(V_1|Z) = 0$.
\end{prop}


\begin{proof}
By Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice}, $D = Z_1 + Z_2 C$. Hence, by Assumption \ref{assump:randchoice} (iii),
\begin{align*}
DY 
%&=  (Z_1 + Z_2 C)\left\{Z_0 Y_0 + Z_1 Y_1 + Z_2[(1 - C) Y_0 + CY_1]\right\}\\
&= Z_1 Y_1 + Z_2 C[(1 -C) Y_0 + C Y_1] = Z_1 Y_1 + Z_2 C Y_1
\end{align*}
because $Z_j^2 = Z_j$ for any $j$ and $Z_j Z_k = 0$ for any $j \neq k$ and, similarly, $(1 - C)^2 = (1 - C)$ and $C (1 - C) = 0$. Therefore, since $Z_2 (1 - C) = Z_2 (1 - D)$,
\[
 DY = (Z_1 + Z_2)Y_1 + Z_2 (D - 1) Y_1, \quad
 DY = Z_1 Y_1 + Z_2 D Y_1.
\]
Now, define
\begin{align*}
V_0 &= (Z_1 + Z_2)[Y_1 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_1)] + Z_2(D - 1)[Y_1 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_1|C=0)]\\
V_1 &= Z_1[Y_1 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_1)] + Z_2D[Y_1 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_1|C=1)].
\end{align*}
%by construction we have
%\begin{align*}
%Y &= \mathbbm{E}(Y_1) \times (Z_1 + Z_2) + \mathbbm{E}(Y_1 | C = 0) \times Z_2 (D - 1) + V_0\\
%Y &= \mathbbm{E}(Y_1) \times Z_1 + \mathbbm{E}(Y_1 | C = 1) \times Z_2 D + V _1.
%\end{align*}
Since $Z_2(1 - D) = Z_2(1 - C)$ and $Z$ is independent of $Y_1$,
\begin{align*}
\mathbbm{E}(V_0|Z) 
%&= (Z_1 + Z_2) [\mathbbm{E}(Y_1|Z) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_1) ]  - Z_2 \mathbbm{E}\{(1 - C)  [Y_1 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_1 | C=0)|Z\} \\
&= -Z_2 \mathbbm{E}[Y_1 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_1 | C=0)|C=0, Z] = 0
\end{align*}
by iterated expectations and the fact that  $Z$ is conditionally independent of $Y_1$ given $C$. 
Since $Z_2 D = Z_2 C$, a similar argument gives
\begin{align*}
\mathbbm{E}(V_1|Z) 
%&= Z_1 [\mathbbm{E}(Y_1 | Z) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_1)]  + Z_2 \mathbbm{E}\{C  [Y_1 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_1 | C=1)|Z\} \\
&= Z_2 \mathbbm{E}[Y_1 - \mathbbm{E}(Y_1 | C=1)|C=1, Z] = 0. \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Inference for ASG, ASB, and ASL}
\label{subsec:inference}

We now explain how to carry out cluster-robust inference for the ASG, ASB, and ASL effects, as implemented in our companion STATA package.
Each of these effects can be expressed as a difference of coefficients from two just-identified linear IV regressions.
The ASG effect is the difference of the \text{TOT} and \text{TUT} effects from Proposition \ref{prop:TOTandTUTregs}. 
Similarly, the ASB effect is the difference of $\mathbb{E}(Y_0|C=1)$ and $\mathbbm{E}(Y_0|C=0)$ from Proposition \ref{prop:ASBreg} while the ASL effect is the difference of $\mathbbm{E}(Y_1|C=1)$ and $\mathbbm{E}(Y_1|C=0)$ from Proposition \ref{prop:ASLreg}.
Within each pair of IV regressions the outcome variable and instrument set is identical; only the regressors differ. 
Since our estimators of all three effects share the same structure, our discussion abstracts from the specific regressors and instruments used in each case.

Let $g = 1, ..., G$ index clusters and $i = 1, ..., N_g$ index individuals within a particular cluster $g$. 
In our experiment, a cluster is a branch-day combination and the experimentally-assigned treatment (control, mandatory, or choice arm) is assigned at the cluster level.
We assume that observations are iid across clusters but potentially correlated within cluster.
Now consider a pair of just-identified linear IV regressions given by
$Y_{ig} = \boldsymbol{X}_{1,ig}' \boldsymbol{\theta}_0 + U_{ig}$ and $Y_{ig} = \boldsymbol{X}_{0,ig}' \boldsymbol{\theta}_1 + V_{ig}$ with common instrument vector $\boldsymbol{W}_{ig}$. 
Stacking observations in the usual manner, e.g.\
$\mathbf{W}_g' \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{W}_{1g} & \cdots & 
\boldsymbol{W}_{N_gg} 
\end{bmatrix}$ and 
$\mathbf{W}' = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{W}_1' & \cdots & \mathbf{W}_G'
\end{bmatrix}$
we can write the preceding equations in matrix form as $\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}_1\boldsymbol{\theta_1} + \mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}_0\boldsymbol{\theta_0} + \mathbf{V}$ with instrument matrix $\mathbf{W}$.
Now, the IV estimators for $\boldsymbol{\theta}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}_0$ can be expressed as 
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_1 
&= \left(\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{X}_1\right)^{-1}\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{Y}  = \boldsymbol{\theta}_1 + \left(\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{X}_1\right)^{-1}\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{U}\\ 
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0 
&= \left(\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{X}_0\right)^{-1}\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{Y} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_0 + \left(\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{X}_0\right)^{-1}\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{V}.
\end{align*}

%Our parameter of interest is an element of the difference $(\theta_1 - \theta_0)$, so it suffices to estimate the asymptotic variance of $(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_1 - \widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0)$.
%Re-arranging the preceding two equations, 
%\begin{align*}
%\sqrt{G} \left(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_1  - \boldsymbol{\theta}_1\right) &= 
% \left(\frac{\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{X}_1}{G}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{U}}{\sqrt{G}}\right) = \left( \frac{1}{G} \sum_{g=1}^G \mathbf{W}_g' \mathbf{X}_{1,g}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{G}} \sum_{g=1}^G\mathbf{W}_g' \mathbf{U}_g\right) \\ 
%\sqrt{G} \left(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0  - \boldsymbol{\theta}_0\right) &= 
% \left(\frac{\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{X}_0}{G}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{V}}{\sqrt{G}}\right) = \left( \frac{1}{G} \sum_{g=1}^G \mathbf{W}_g' \mathbf{X}_{0,g}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{G}} \sum_{g=1}^G\mathbf{W}_g' \mathbf{V}_g\right).
%\end{align*}
%Now, define $\mathbf{Q}_0 \equiv \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{W}_g'\mathbf{X}_{0g}]$ and $\mathbf{Q}_1 \equiv \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{W}_g'\mathbf{X}_{1g}]$ and suppose that these expectations exist and that the matrices $\mathbf{Q}_0$ and $\mathbf{Q}_1$ are invertible. Then, as $G \rightarrow \infty$
%\[
% \left( \frac{1}{G} \sum_{g=1}^G \mathbf{W}_g' \mathbf{X}_{0,g}\right)^{-1} \rightarrow_p \mathbf{Q}_0^{-1}, \quad
% \left( \frac{1}{G} \sum_{g=1}^G \mathbf{W}_g' \mathbf{X}_{1,g}\right)^{-1} \rightarrow_p \mathbf{Q}_1^{-1} \quad
%\]
%by the continuous mapping theorem.
By our experimental design and exclusion restriction, $\mathbf{W}_{ig}$ is independent of $U_{ig}$ both unconditionally and conditional on cluster size. 
%Therefore,
%\begin{align*}
%\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{W}_g' \mathbf{U}_g] &=  \mathbb{E}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^{N_g} \mathbf{W}_{ig} U_{ig} \right] = \mathbb{E}_{N_g}\left[ \mathbb{E}\left\{\left. \sum_{i=1}^{N_g} \mathbf{W}_{ig} U_{ig} \right| N_g \right\}\right]\\
%&= \mathbb{E}_{N_g}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^{N_g} \mathbb{E}(\mathbf{W}_{ig} U_{ig}|N_g)\right] = \mathbb{E}_{N_g}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^{N_g} \mathbb{E}(\mathbf{W}_{ig}U_{ig})\right] = 0
%\end{align*}
%by iterated expectations, and similarly smilarly, $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{W}_g'\mathbf{V}_g] = \mathbf{0}$. 
%Thus, under mild regularity conditions (e.g.\ finite fourth moments), as $G \rightarrow \infty$  we have
%\[
%\frac{1}{\sqrt{G}} \sum_{g=1}^G \mathbf{W}_g' \otimes \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{U}_g \\ \mathbf{V}_g \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow_d \text{N}(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Omega})
%\]
%where the heteroskedasticity-- and cluster--robust variance-covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ is 
%\[
%\boldsymbol{\Omega} \equiv 
% \mathbb{E} \left[\left(\mathbf{W}_g \mathbf{W}_g' \right)\otimes \begin{pmatrix}
%\mathbf{U}_g \mathbf{U}_g' & \mathbf{U}_g \mathbf{V}_g' \\
%\mathbf{V}_g \mathbf{U}_g' & \mathbf{V}_g \mathbf{V}_g'  
%\end{pmatrix} \right] \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
%\Omega_{UU} & \Omega_{UV} \\
%\Omega_{VU} & \Omega_{VV}
%\end{bmatrix}.
%\]
%Therefore, the joint limiting distribution of $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_1$ and $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0$ is given by
%\[
%\begin{bmatrix}
%\sqrt{G}(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_1 - \boldsymbol{\theta}_1)\\
%\sqrt{G}(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0 - \boldsymbol{\theta}_0)
%\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow_d
%\begin{bmatrix}
%\mathbf{Q}_1^{-1} & \mathbf{0} \\
%\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{Q}_0^{-1} 
%\end{bmatrix}
%\begin{bmatrix}
%\boldsymbol{\xi}_U \\ \boldsymbol{\xi}_V 
%\end{bmatrix}, \quad
%\begin{bmatrix}
%\boldsymbol{\xi}_U \\ \boldsymbol{\xi}_V 
%\end{bmatrix} \sim \text{N}\left(\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{0} \\ \mathbf{0}\end{bmatrix},
%\begin{bmatrix}
%\Omega_{UU} & \Omega_{UV} \\
%\Omega_{VU} & \Omega_{VV}
%\end{bmatrix}\right)
%\]
%from which it follows by the continuous mapping theorem that
%\[
%\sqrt{G}\left[ (\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_1 - \widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0 ) - (\boldsymbol{\theta}_1 - \boldsymbol{\theta}_0)\right] 
%\rightarrow_d
%\begin{bmatrix}
%\mathbf{Q}_1^{-1} & -\mathbf{Q}_0^{-1}
%\end{bmatrix}
%\begin{bmatrix}
%\boldsymbol{\xi}_U \\ \boldsymbol{\xi}_V 
%\end{bmatrix}.
%\]
%To use this result in practice, we estimate the standard errors of  $(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_1 - \widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0)$ as the square root of the diagonal elements of the matrix
Hence, by a standard argument and under mild regularity conditions, the following expression provides a consistent, cluster robust estimator of $\widehat{\text{Avar}}(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_1 - \widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0)$ 
\[
\widehat{\text{Avar}}(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_1 - \widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0) 
= \begin{bmatrix}
\left(\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{X}_1\right)^{-1} &
-\left(\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{X}_0\right)^{-1} 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{S}_{UU}& \mathbf{S}_{UV}\\
\mathbf{S}_{UV}'& \mathbf{S}_{VV}
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\left(\mathbf{X}_1'\mathbf{W}\right)^{-1} \\
-\left(\mathbf{X}_0'\mathbf{W}\right)^{-1} 
\end{bmatrix}
\]
where we define the IV residuals
$\widehat{\mathbf{U}}_g \equiv \mathbf{Y}_g - \mathbf{X}_{1,g}\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_1$ and
$\widehat{\mathbf{V}}_g \equiv \mathbf{Y}_g - \mathbf{X}_{0,g}\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0$ along with the matrices
$\mathbf{S}_{UU} \equiv \sum_{g=1}^G \mathbf{W}_g' \widehat{\mathbf{U}}_g \widehat{\mathbf{U}}_g' \mathbf{W}_g$,
$\mathbf{S}_{UV} \equiv \sum_{g=1}^G \mathbf{W}_g' \widehat{\mathbf{U}}_g \widehat{\mathbf{V}}_g' \mathbf{W}_g$, and finally
$\mathbf{S}_{VV} \equiv \sum_{g=1}^G \mathbf{W}_g' \widehat{\mathbf{V}}_g \widehat{\mathbf{V}}_g' \mathbf{W}_g$.
In our application the number of clusters, $G$, is large.
If desired, an \emph{ad hoc} degrees of freedom correction can be applied by multiplying the associated standard errors by $\sqrt{G/(G-1)}$.

\section{Can we target paternalism accurately?} \label{targeting}
\todo[inline]{Now that this is in the appendix, and given that some of the sections it refers to are set to be re-organized in a substantial way, this may need to be edited later. We should do this after we're already happy with the body of the paper.}

Even though the overwhelming majority of borrowers would save on financing costs, not all of them would, according to our estimates. Is it possible to target paternalism only towards those who would benefit from it?  

The answer depends on how predictive the covariate information is of treatment effects. Note that to implement a targeting protocol, the covariate information used in the model would need to be either verifiable or hard to manipulate. In our survey and administrative data, this leaves us with only a few covariates: age, gender, high school education or above, desired loan size, and whether that individual has ever pawned before. 
We call these the ``narrow'' covariate set, to contrast with the full set of survey variables, which we call the ``wide'' covariate set.  We take the estimated   $\widehat{\text{CATE}}(X_i)$ using the wide covariates as our ground truth.\footnote{We assign a dummy variable equal to one for the 90\% of borrowers who have a positive CATE using the wide covariate set. Figure \ref{wide_narrow_forests} shows the relationship between these two different  CATEs.  We generate substantially less heterogeneity when using the narrow covariate set, although we still reject the null hypothesis of no treatment effect heterogeneity with the test from \cite{chernozhukov2018generic}.} 

To investigate targeting we ask how well we can predict this ground truth using the narrow covariate set, which is the set of less-manipulable variables that the pawnlender has. We use both a logistic regression and a random forest classification model using the narrow covariate set to predict positive benefits at the individual level.  We compare the in-sample performance of targeting rules against a policy of universal mandated structure.


\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Type I \& II errors using targeting narrow rules}
\label{hit_miss_rule}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{\input{./Tables/hit_miss_rule.tex}}
\end{center}
\scriptsize{This table reports error rates for six different rules for allocating individuals to structured repayment. Row 1 assigns all borrowers to control, Row 2 all to structured payments. Row 3 uses `optimal targeting according to the CATE from the wide covariate set. Row 4 uses a random forest classification, and Row 5 a logit model, both with only the narrow covariate set.  Row 6 uses the choices made by borrowers. %DoFile : wide_narrow_forests.do
}
\end{table} 

\todo[inline]{The editor asks: ``how is “Overall Error Rate” computed in Table 5? (Type I and II errors using targeting narrow rules) It’s always the sum of the previous columns except for the last row.''}

Table \ref{hit_miss_rule} shows error rates for six possible assignment rules: assigning all borrowers to Status quo, all to structured payments, the optimal (wide-fores), the random forest with narrow covariates, the Logistic model with narrow covariates, and the actual choice made by borrowers.  All models take the wide RF as the ground truth. While the narrow RF correctly assigns to control roughly half of those who do not benefit from the structures payment contract, it also incorrectly allocates to control 4.38\%  that would gain from structured payments. As such, it only improves the overall correct targeting rate by about half of a percentage point relative to universal structure. The Logit assignment rule is even less successful at predicting benefits and harms, with a higher share of borrowers incorrectly assigned to both treatment and control, meaning that the overall correct targeting rate for the Logit is 5 pp \textit{lower} than universal structure to structured payments.  Self-targeting through choice proves to be little better than assigning everyone to the Status quo contract, given the low take-up rate and the presence of both Type I and Type II errors in the choice arm.  

The takeaway is that given (a) low take-up, (b) the large fraction of the sample benefiting from structure, (c) and the weak predictive power of the narrow covariates, universal paternalism assigning all borrowers to the strutured contract appears to be an attractive targeting method in our context.
