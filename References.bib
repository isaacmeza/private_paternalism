    abstract = "{ContextLow adherence with prescribed treatments is ubiquitous and undermines
treatment benefits.ObjectiveTo systematically review published randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
of interventions to assist patients' adherence to prescribed medications.Data SourcesA search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PSYCHLIT, SOCIOFILE, IPA, EMBASE, The Cochrane
Library databases, and bibliographies was performed for records from 1967
through August 2001 to identify relevant articles of all RCTs of interventions
intended to improve adherence to self-administered medications.Study Selection and Data ExtractionStudies were included if they reported an unconfounded RCT of an intervention
to improve adherence with prescribed medications for a medical or psychiatric
disorder; both adherence and treatment outcome were measured; follow-up of
at least 80\\% of each study group was reported; and the duration of follow-up
for studies with positive initial findings was at least 6 months. Information
on study design features, interventions, controls, and findings (adherence
rates and patient outcomes) were extracted for each article.Data SynthesisStudies were too disparate to warrant meta-analysis. Forty-nine percent
of the interventions tested (19 of 39 in 33 studies) were associated with
statistically significant increases in medication adherence and only 17 reported
statistically significant improvements in treatment outcomes. Almost all the
interventions that were effective for long-term care were complex, including
combinations of more convenient care, information, counseling, reminders,
self-monitoring, reinforcement, family therapy, and other forms of additional
supervision or attention. Even the most effective interventions had modest
effects.ConclusionsCurrent methods of improving medication adherence for chronic health
problems are mostly complex, labor-intensive, and not predictably effective.
The full benefits of medications cannot be realized at currently achievable
levels of adherence; therefore, more studies of innovative approaches to assist
patients to follow prescriptions for medications are needed.}",

abstract = {Stress affects cognition in a number of ways, acting rapidly via catecholamines and more slowly via glucocorticoids. Catecholamine actions involve beta adrenergic receptors and also availability of glucose, whereas glucocorticoids biphasically modulate synaptic plasticity over hours and also produce longer-term changes in dendritic structure that last for weeks. Prolonged exposure to stress leads to loss of neurons, particularly in the hippocampus. Recent evidence suggests that the glucocorticoid- and stress-related cognitive impairments involving declarative memory are probably related to the changes they effect in the hippocampus, whereas the stress-induced catecholamine effects on emotionally laden memories are postulated to involve structures such as the amgydala.}

abstract = {Many decisions must be made under stress, and many decision situations elicit stress responses themselves. Thus, stress and decision making are intricately connected, not only on the behavioral level, but also on the neural level, i.e., the brain regions that underlie intact decision making are regions that are sensitive to stress-induced changes. The purpose of this review is to summarize the findings from studies that investigated the impact of stress on decision making. The review includes those studies that examined decision making under stress in humans and were published between 1985 and October 2011. The reviewed studies were found using PubMed and PsycInfo searches. The review focuses on studies that have examined the influence of acutely induced laboratory stress on decision making and that measured both decision-making performance and stress responses. Additionally, some studies that investigated decision making under naturally occurring stress levels and decision-making abilities in patients who suffer from stress-related disorders are described. The results from the studies that were included in the review support the assumption that stress affects decision making. If stress confers an advantage or disadvantage in terms of outcome depends on the specific task or situation. The results also emphasize the role of mediating and moderating variables. The results are discussed with respect to underlying psychological and neural mechanisms, implications for everyday decision making and future research directions.}

    abstract = { Procrastination is all too familiar to most people. People delay writing up their research (so we hear!), repeatedly declare they will start their diets tomorrow, or postpone until next week doing odd jobs around the house. Yet people also sometimes attempt to control their procrastination by setting deadlines for themselves. In this article, we pose three questions: (a) Are people willing to self-impose meaningful (i.e., costly) deadlines to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance? (c) When self-imposing deadlines, do people set them optimally, for maximum performance enhancement? A set of studies examined these issues experimentally, showing that the answer is “yes” to the first two questions, and “nO'’ to the third. People have self-control problems, they recognize them, and they try to control them by self-imposing costly deadlines. These deadlines help people control procrastination, but they are not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in improving task performance. }

It deals with the role of information that is available about other individuals through a propensity score. It also shows the reason for absence of propensity score in the likelihood function but its appearance in the prior. A prior distribution leads to a closed-form expression for the decision rule. The parametric model plays the role of a prior distribution that can be dominated by the data. The next section examines the role of the propensity score in a random effects model with normal distributions for the outcomes and the random effects. It takes up the extension to the case of treatment selection based on unobservables. The main aim of this article is to estimate an average treatment effect for a particular covariate cell.}",

This paper proposes a simpleexplanation based on present bias. For such individuals, more frequent repaymentcan increase the maximum incentive compatible loan size. However, the welfareeffects are ambiguous. More frequent repayment can lead to over-borrowing,reducing welfare as it increases loan sizes.4},

    abstract = { Commitment products can remedy self-control problems. However, imperfect knowledge about their preferences may (discontinuously) lead individuals to select into incentive-incompatible commitments, which reduce their welfare. I conducted a field experiment in which low-income individuals were randomly offered a new installment-savings commitment account. Individuals chose a personalized savings plan and a default penalty themselves. A majority appears to choose a harmful contract: While the average effect on bank savings is large, 55\% of clients default and incur monetary losses. A possible explanation is that the chosen penalties were too low (the commitment was too weak) to overcome clients’ self-control problems. Measures of sophisticated hyperbolic discounting correlate negatively with take-up and default, and positively with penalty choices. This finding is consistent with theoretical predictions that partial sophisticates adopt weak commitments and then default, whereas full sophisticates are more cautious about committing, but better able to choose incentive-compatible contracts.This paper was accepted by John List, behavioral economics. }

When people are influenced by sunk costs in their decision making, they are said to be committing the “sunk cost fallacy.” Contrary to conventional wisdom, we argue that in a broad range of situations, it is rational for people to condition behavior on sunk costs because of informational content, reputational concerns, or financial and time constraints. Once all the elements of the decision-making environment are taken into account, reacting to sunk costs can often be understood as rational behavior. (JEL D0, D01, D8, D81, D83, D9, D90)},

The evidence is consistent with people striving to live up to others' expectations so as to avoid guilt, as can be modeled using psychological game theory. When players exhibit such guilt aversion, communication may influence motivation and behavior by influencing beliefs about beliefs. Promises may enhance trustworthy behavior, which is what we observe. We argue that guilt aversion may be relevant for understanding strategic interaction in a variety of settings, and that it may shed light on the role of language, discussions, agreements, and social norms in these contexts.},

Even when trustee messages are not delivered to trustors, trustees who make a promise are more likely to act trustworthy than those who do not make a promise. However, we subsequently ran a control treatment with restricted (non-promise) communication to examine whether the correlation between promises and trustworthiness is causal. The results show that the absence of promises does not decrease average cooperation rates. This indicates that promises do not induce trustworthiness, they are just more likely to be sent by cooperators than by non-cooperators.",

abstract="Two rationales have emerged for why individuals keep their promises: (a) an emotional commitment to keep actions and words consistent, a commitment rationale and (b) avoidance of guilt due to not meeting the expectations of the promisee, an expectations rationale. We propose a new dichotomy with clearer distinctions between rationales: (1) an internal consistency rationale, which is the desire to keep actions and words consistent regardless of others' awareness of the promise and (2) a communication rationale, which captures all aspects of promise keeping that are associated with the promisee having learned of the promise, including but not limited to promisee expectations. Using an experiment that manipulates whether promises are delivered, we find no support for the internal consistency rationale; only delivered promises are relevant. In a second experiment designed to better understand what aspect of promise delivery influences promisor behavior, we manipulate whether the promise is delivered before or after the promisee is able to take a trusting action. We find late-arriving promises are relevant though not as relevant as promises delivered before the promisee chooses whether to take the trusting action. We conclude that implicit contracting does not fully explain promise keeping, because had it done so, late-arriving promises would also be irrelevant.",

This paper seeks to test two theories to explain this effect. The first posits that individuals have a preference for keeping their word. The second assumes that people dislike letting down others' payoff expectations. According to the latter account, promises affect behavior only indirectly, because they lead to changes in the payoff expectations attributed to others. I conduct an experiment designed to distinguish between and test these alternative explanations. The results demonstrate that the effects of promises cannot be accounted for by changes in payoff expectations. This suggests that people have a preference for promise keeping per se.},

We suggest that an explanation for this well-documented observation lies in the ubiquitous use of regularly scheduled repayments by MFIs. Borrowers are typically required to repay their loans in tightly structured installments, beginning soon after loan disbursement. This little-remarked aspect of the repayment schedule is usually explained as inculcating ‘fiscal discipline’ among borrowers. We argue that an alternative rationale for this loan repayment structure lies in the difficulty of monitoring borrowers' actions. The potential for moral hazard leads MFIs to use innovative mechanisms, such as regularly scheduled repayments, which indirectly coopt the better-informed informal lenders. Conversely, this installment repayment structure allows informal lenders to survive. Further, we show that this linkage can not only expand the volume of informal lending, but may also raise the interest rate in the informal sector."

Even though economic theory suggests that a more flexible repayment schedule would benefit clients and potentially improve their repayment capacity, micro-finance practitioners argue that the fiscal discipline imposed by frequent repayment is critical to preventing loan default. In this paper we use data from a field experiment which randomized client assignment to a weekly or monthly repayment schedule and find no significant effect of type of repayment schedule on client delinquency or default. Our findings suggest that, among micro-finance clients who are willing to borrow at either weekly or monthly repayment schedules, a more flexible schedule can significantly lower transaction costs without increasing client default.},

One month later, we offered the commitment product to a randomly chosen subset of 710 clients; 202 (28.4 percent) accepted the offer and opened the account. In the baseline survey, we asked hypothetical time discounting questions. Women who exhibited a lower discount rate for future relative to current trade-offs, and hence potentially have a preference for commitment, were indeed significantly more likely to open the commitment savings account. Mter twelve months, average savings balances increased by 81 percentage points for those clients assigned to the treatment group relative to those assigned to the control group.

The model is estimated with instruments based on randomized admission lotteries and distance to charter schools. Charter schools generate larger gains for disadvantaged students, but demand for charters is stronger among more advantaged students. Similarly, gains are inversely related to unobserved preferences for charters. As a result, counterfactual simulations indicate that charter expansion is likely to be most effective when accompanied by efforts to target students who are unlikely to apply. }

 abstract = {A popular way to account for unobserved heterogeneity is to assume that the data are drawn from a finite mixture distribution. A barrier to using finite mixture models is that parameters that could previously be estimated in stages must now be estimated jointly: using mixture distributions destroys any additive separability of the log-likelihood function. We show, however, that an extension of the EM algorithm reintroduces additive separability, thus allowing one to estimate parameters sequentially during each maximization step. In establishing this result, we develop a broad class of estimators for mixture models. Returning to the likelihood problem, we show that, relative to full information maximum likelihood, our sequential estimator can generate large computational savings with little loss of efficiency.},

During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems. We discuss the formulation and theoretical and practical properties of the EM algorithm for mixture densities, focussing in particular on mixtures of densities from exponential families.},

Under mild regularity conditions, any discrete choice model derived from random utility maximization has choice probabilities that can be approximated as closely as one pleases by a MMNL model. Practical estimation of a parametric mixing family can be carried out by Maximum Simulated Likelihood Estimation or Method of Simulated Moments, and easily computed instruments are provided that make the latter procedure fairly efficient. The adequacy of a mixing specification can be tested simply as an omitted variable test with appropriately defined artificial variables. An application to a problem of demand for alternative vehicles shows that MMNL provides a flexible and computationally practical approach to discrete response analysis.},

The procedures are specific types of the well known EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm based on three different ways of approximating the mixing distribution nonparametrically: (1) a discrete distribution with mass points and frequencies treated as parameters, (2) a discrete mixture of continuous distributions, with the moments and weight for each distribution treated as parameters, and (3) a discrete distribution with fixed mass points whose frequencies are treated as parameters. The methods are illustrated with a mixed logit model of households' choices among alternative-fueled vehicles.}

 abstract = {The EM algorithm is a much used tool for maximum likelihood estimation in missing or incomplete data problems. However, calculating the conditional expectation required in the E-step of the algorithm may be infeasible, especially when this expectation is a large sum or a high-dimensional integral. Instead the expectation can be estimated by simulation. This is the common idea in the stochastic EM algorithm and the Monte Carlo EM algorithm. In this paper some asymptotic results for the Stochastic EM algorithm are given, and estimation based on this algorithm is discussed. In particular, asymptotic equivalence of certain simple estimators is shown, and a simulation experiment is carried out to investigate this equivalence in small and moderate samples. Furthermore, some implementation issues and the possibility of allowing unidentified parameters in the algorithm are discussed.},

abstract = {We first show that one-sample and two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests may be interpreted as multiple testing procedures, nonparametrically testing equality at each point in the distribution with strong control of the finite-sample familywise error rate. Second, we provide an alternative procedure that distributes power across the distribution more evenly than the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, which suffers low sensitivity to tail deviations. Third, we provide a formula for near-instant one-sample computation. Fourth, we improve power with stepdown and pre-test procedures. Finally, we extend our results to conditional distributions and regression discontinuity designs. Simulations, empirical examples, and code are provided.}

 abstract = {We derive testable implications of instrument validity in just identified treatment effect models with endogeneity and consider several tests. The identifying assumptions of the local average treatment effect allow us to both point identify and bound the mean potential outcomes of the always takers under treatment and the never takers under nontreatment. The point-identified means must lie within their respective bounds, which provides us with four testable inequality moment constraints. Finally, we adapt our testing framework to the identification of distributional features. A brief simulation study and an application to labor market data are also provided.},

In this article, we introduce a corresponding new command, rforest. We overview the random forest algorithm and illustrate its use with two examples: The first example is a classification problem that predicts whether a credit card holder will default on his or her debt. The second example is a regression problem that predicts the logscaled number of shares of online news articles. We conclude with a discussion that summarizes key points demonstrated in the examples. }
