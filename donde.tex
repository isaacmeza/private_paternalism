%Many firms provide commitment devices that restrict individuals' choice, but shroud this. Shrouding suggests low demand for commitment. We show that private paternalism is beneficial in the pawnbroker context we study. 

In the context of pawnbroker lending, we show that forcing people into commitment contracts with financial penalties for not paying on time \textit{decreases} their (fee-including) financial cost by 9.4\%, increases the likelihood of recovering their pawn by 26\%, and increases the likelihood of repeat business by almost 100\%. Using machine learning methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, we find that more than {70}\% clients would reduce their financing cost with the commitment contract, however only 10\% choose it. Those that \textit{don't} choose it are predicted to be the ones who would benefit more. Relying on personal promises instead of fees as commitment triples take-up but has no effects on outcomes.

%and one of the most understudied. In our context more than on half of borrowers default and lose their pawn and whatever they have paid towards recovering it. Compared to the status quo pay-at-anytime 3-month contracts, forcing borrowers to pay monthly and charge a penalty if they didn't --i.e. a commitment contract-- increased recovery of pawn by about 30\% and financial costs by 10\%. However when offered a choice between the two contracts only 10\% took the monthly payment one. A pecuniary commitment seems necessary. In an alternative arm, we made them promise to pay but removed the pecuniary penalty. This increased take up to 31\%, but had zero effect on financing cost or default. The forcing contract may be better than choice for naive present biased consumers.

\section{Introduction}
Many people have a difficult time accumulating and retaining capital unless they are provided a structure within which to do so.  The behavioral lens on intertemporal financial services has provided critical insights on this problem, suggesting that saving from cash-in-hand is challenging \citep{Ashraf, Pascaline}, that credit may be preferred to savings as a way of accumulating capital simply because credit repayment contracts provide more structure \cite{Murdoch}, and even that the absence of structured financial contracts may be a key barrier preventing the poor from climbing out of poverty \citep{bertrand2004behavioral, collins2009portfolios}.  A large behavioral literature has illustrated that the addition of commitment-style product features improves the ability to accumulate savings \citep{thaler2004save, prina2015banking, brune2016facilitating, callen2019headwaters} and to retire debt \citep{Bertrand, heidhues2010exploiting}.  As a consequence, credit markets featuring limited-liability loans such as small-business financing or microfinance typically take a highly structured approach to credit contracts with frequent repayments and reminders as a way of inducing repayment.  As pointed out by \cite{Laibson2018}, because many of these forms of commitment may be desirable to principals but not demanded by agents (or by the right agents), these mechanisms are often ‘shrouded’, meaning that commitment is embedded in products in ways that are not advertised to clients as such.

In this paper we examine pawn contracts, an understudied form of credit despite their relative ubiquity \citep{carter2012pawnshops}, and a major vehicle through which poor households may dis-accumulate savings.  There are more than 11,000 pawn shops across the US, with 30 million clients and \$14 billion yearly revenues.  In China it is a 43 billion dollar industry.\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/ybm56dpe}, \url{https://tinyurl.com/y9zdcgws}, \url{https://tinyurl.com/y59ptdam}.} Our partner, a Mexican pawn lender (henceforth Lender $P$) alone served more than 1 million clients in the last 3 years with more than 4 million contracts.  Pawnshop lending presents an inverted lending case:  since these loans are over-capitalized, the principal in the lending contract stands to gain the most when agents default.  Our collaborating lender gave only 70\% of the value of the pawn in credit, and charged a monthly interest rate of 7\% for loans of a three-month duration, with a flexible no-reminders contract typical of the industry that can be paid back anytime before the loan comes due.  This combination of features means that the lender makes 90\% more profit over three months for a borrower who defaults than one who repays (30\% of collateral value recovered under default, 15.8\% of collateral value paid in interest if loan fully repaid).  While an older literature considers the exploitative potential in over-collateralization and underpricing of collateral \citep{basu1984implicit}, the implication of such contracts has not been analyzed in the behavioral literature.  When the lender desires default, the repayment-inducing features of commitment-style repayment contracts become undesirable and there may be incentives for the principal to create contracts with no structure, no reminders, and simple balloon payments that represent the opposite of what the behavioral literature tells us will induce repayment. To repurpose the language of \cite{Laibson2018}, we suggest that pawn contracts effectively shroud their \textit{lack} of commitment to induce default in a manner not obvious to borrowers.  Given that pawnshops, moneylenders, and paycheck lending institutions are likely to face client pools disproportionately made up of impatient and time-inconsistent individuals, the design of such contracts may have first-order consequences for the financial lives of the poor.

Against this backdrop, we implement a multi-arm randomized control trial covering close to 10,000 pawnshop clients in 6 branches of Lender $P$ in Mexico City, using a design built to test the demand for and impact of commitment in pawn repayment contracts.  Our control arm illustrates the costs of the status quo contract; fully 57\% of borrowers default and so lose their pawn.  We then implement a `commitment choice’ arm, in which borrowers are able at the time of taking a loan to opt in to a structured repayment contract, in which they are asked to make three monthly payments rather than one balloon payment at the end, with each monthly payment including the accrued interest at that time, and borrowers levied a nominal fee of 2\% of that month's payment in case of delinquency as a reminder/reinforcement of the importance of these interim payments.  In addition, we include a `forced commitment’ arm, in which all borrowers are required to repay using the commitment structure.  The combination of voluntary and forced commitment in the same study allows us to address several key questions.  First, does using more structured repayment contracts help pawnshop borrowers to achieve higher repayment rates, thereby saving them money?  Second, do borrowers recognize this benefit, demanding commitment in sufficient numbers to meaningfully change repayment behavior?  Finally, and most uniquely, because we incorporate the forced commitment arm, we are able to ask whether the \textit{right} borrowers voluntarily demand commitment, gaining point identification for the treatment on compliers and the treatment on non-compliers by comparison across the control, choice, and forced arms. 
	
Our results suggest that the structure of the commitment is strongly effective in preventing default, with the average individual in the forced arm paying financing costs inclusive of fees that are 9.4\% lower than the control (from \$3157 to \$2860 MXN), while the likelihood of recovering their pawn increases by 26\% (from 43\% to 55\%).  Results are robust qualitatively to including transport costs of going to the branch plus losing a day's wage for each visit, suggesting that in the context of a commitment structure it is possible to save borrowers money by charging them fees!  Importantly, the benefits are distributed broadly: almost the whole distribution of treatment effects shows cost savings; however those most economically vulnerable, and those most overconfident about their probability of repayment, experience larger gains.\footnote{As in \cite{Rabin2018} we contrast subjects' \textit{own predictions} of their behavior with their actual behavior, but we do it in a natural setting.}  Treatment effects are concentrated in the intensive margin as treatment does not affect the fraction of clients who pay a positive amount towards pawn recovery. That is, the commitment contract induces people who would otherwise pay something towards recovery, to pay more and faster and thus recover their pawn more at a cheaper financial cost.  

Borrowers assigned to the forced commitment contract are 5 percentage points (100\% of the mean) more likely than the control group to ask for another loan in the future, suggesting that they liked the commitment contract after experiencing it.  However, when offered the choice of commitment, very few borrowers elect to commit voluntarily.  Only 10\% of the choice arm takes up the contract, and none of the core study outcomes are significantly improved by the ability to choose commitment.  

Most importantly, our multi-arm design allows us to show that the \textit{wrong} people choose commitment when offered it.   We illustrate this point in three distinct ways.  First, we use a Random Forest algorithm \citep{atheygrf} to estimate individual-level treatment effects for the forced versus control arm, and show the benefits of forcing to be significantly negatively correlated with the propensity to choose commitment estimated from the choice arm.  93\% of those who did not opt for the commitment contract would have been better off with it, while only 1\% of those who chose commitment would have been better off without it.  Second, a Boosted Classification Algorithm arrives at a similar answer, showing that the borrowers naturally cluster into two groups, one of which is likely to choose commitment and does not benefit from it, and the other the reverse.  Finally, estimating LATEs on compliers and non-compliers alike we show that the estimated treatment effect on non-compliers is larger than the treatment effect on compliers.  That is, those choosing commitment benefit less from commitment than those not choosing it.  Hence our results show clearly that a paternalistic policy forcing borrowers into a more rigid and structured repayment regimen is uniquely beneficial to them.  While this perverse relationship between choice and benefits from commitment echo closely the findings of \cite{Sprenger} we are the first to be able to examine this relationship using a high-stakes, money-metric outcome in a natural field environment.

Additional evidence of the importance of paternalism in pawnshop commitment is provided by two additional study arms offering variants of `soft' commitment.  In one arm all borrowers were asked to commit to make three monthly payments instead of a single balloon payment, but no external reminders or fees were imposed.  In a second arm borrowers were given the ability to choose whether to engage in this form of soft commitment.  Both of these arms are completely ineffective, suggesting that it is the combination of external imposition of the contract along with the teeth provided by the reminder and fees that generate the savings to borrowers relative to the status quo contract.

What explains the persistence of a contract so contrary to borrowers’ interests?  First, we show substantial levels of over-optimism among borrowers.  Those most likely to benefit from the commitment contract and \textit{not} choose it are the individuals who most systematically over-estimate their own probability of repayment at the time of taking the loan.  Second, the existence of commitment-style repayment contracts in pawnshop lending is novel in Mexico.  While forcing individuals into commitment does not cause them to demand it in subsequent loans, \textcolor{red}{in Table \ref{iv_pf}} we show observational evidence of `learning by not doing’:  individuals offered commitment who elect not to take it \textcolor{red}{and subsequently default} \textit{do} learn about the benefits of commitment, demanding commitment loans at higher rates on subsequent pawn contracts when given the choice.  Finally, while we are working with a lender who has a social mission and is interested in understanding how to help borrowers, there is no free lunch.  The dramatic improvements in borrower income arising from the commitment contract come directly from the pockets of lenders, reinforcing that the pawn industry as a whole has a strong interest in retaining the status quo.

Our results suggest that pawn lending markets capture borrower wealth in ways not well summarized by interest rates.  By overcollateralizing and then structuring loan contracts in a manner encouraging of default, lenders are able to extract substantial value independent of the interest charged.  Further, the `nudge’ approach generally favored by the behavioral literature (voluntary commitment) may not be adequate; we estimate that over 50\% of the borrowers in our study are naïve hyperbolics in the sense that they would benefit from commitment but will not choose it.  While our results are driven by the intersection of overcollateralization and a potential selection of the borrower pool towards myopia and short-term financial thinking, these attributes are likely to be present in many types of pro-poor financial markets where individuals lack the credit histories to be able to leverage short-term credit without collateral.  This suggests that regulators of such markets would do well to consider the broader financial costs of lending products, including what is paid through equilibrium default, and to consider imposing more structured lending products that tilt the scales towards allowing borrowers to repay.  While commitment-style repayment contracts decrease effective liquidity by requiring faster repayment of a given loan, the improvement in expected borrower returns are so substantial as to prove welfare improving at all but the most astronomical discount rates.  



These conclusions speak to several strands of the literature.  First, they suggest consequential ways in which different financial services draw client pools with distinct behavioral biases.  While research in microfinance markets has not found the same benefits from providing a more regularized repayment environment \citep{Pande}, those experiments are performed over the top of highly structured contracts and among borrower pools who may have selected into that type of lending precisely because it provides structure.  Second, we broaden the analysis of the extent to which voluntary commitment mechanisms are desirable.  Like our study, commitment demand has been found to be low in a number of contexts (\cite{Ashraf}, \cite{Gine}, \cite{Ted}, \cite{Royer}, \cite{Sprenger}), and by illustrating a mechanism for the failure of self-commitment (over-optimism) we may help contextualize those studies in which demand has been found to be more robust (\cite{Kremer},  \cite{Casaburi}, \cite{Alcohol}, \cite{AprajitP&P}, \cite{Pascaline}). Finally, we provide only the second case in the literature, and the first in the analysis of financial products, to illustrate the perverse result that those who opt into commitment are precisely the individuals who do not need it \citep{Sprenger}.


The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:  section \ref{context} provides context and describes the data sources. Section \ref{Data} presents summary statistics and defines our main outcome variables. Section \ref{Experiment} describes the experiment and shows pre-treatment balance across arms. Section \ref{fee-commitment} estimates the effect of forcing clients into the fee-commitment contract, while Section \ref{fee-choice} studies the effects of choice. Section \ref{conclusion} concludes.




%\section{Old Introduction}

%Many institutions ---firms, schools, financial contracts--- restrict choice using built-in commitment mechanisms which help workers, students, borrowers overcome self-control problems. For instance, ``[mortgages restrict choice] with a fixed repayment stream and mandatory principal repayment'' \citep{Laibson2018}.\footnote{\cite{Laibson2018} also mentions that ``Firms do limit their workers' freedom with intermediate deadlines, progress reports, production targets'', and schools with ``pop quizzes, classroom attendance requirements, cold calling, graded problem sets, deadlines''.} At the same time  these same firms shroud and don't market these commitment features, presumably because students, workers and borrowers don't welcome these restrictions. \cite{Laibson2018} argues that this presents an important puzzle: clients that would benefit from commitment underestimate its value and thus have low demand for it. In such a case private paternalism may be beneficial.\footnote{Laibson defines paternalism as a policy that advances an individual's interests by restricting his or her freedom, and private paternalism as paternalism implemented by private institutions. %In this paper we will study the effect of restricting freedom of contract choice on two outcomes: pawn recovery and financing cost, not overall welfare.
%We want to clarify that we are using the word ``paternalism'' in a restricted sense, meaning only that a large majority of clients would incur in lower financial costs from being forced into installment contracts instead of letting them choose. We are not making claims about overall welfare which is a slippery concept if we take into account the possibility of biased beliefs and preferences.} 

%This paper studies the benefits of restricting choice in the context of pawnbroker lending. Pawn loans are one of the oldest, most understudied, and most prevalent forms of borrowing. There are more than 11,000 pawn shops across the US, with 30 million clients and \$14 billion yearly revenues. In China it is a 43 billion dollar industry.\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/ybm56dpe}, \url{https://tinyurl.com/y9zdcgws}, \url{https://tinyurl.com/y59ptdam}.} Our partner pawn lender (henceforth Lender $P$) alone served more than 1 million clients in the last 3 years with more than 4 million contracts. The key characteristic of pawn loans is that the borrower leaves personal property (a pawn) as collateral in exchange for an immediate cash loan of a smaller value. In our case Lender $P$ only accepts gold jewelry as collateral and approves all pawns, giving cash the equivalent of 70\% of the pawn's appraised value. The contract stipulates a 7\% monthly interest rate charged daily, a loan term of 90 days, and the flexibility to pay back the loan at anytime before the loan is due. In spite of this flexibility ---or perhaps because of it--- 60\% of clients lose their pawn\footnote{In the US default is also high at 15\% (\url{https://tinyurl.com/yc2x5bjf}).}, and among those that recover it almost all of them pay in the days just before the loan elapses.

% About 85\% of borrower lose their pawn\footnote{https://nationalpawnbrokers.org/2017/06/19/pawnbroking-around-the-world/}

%Borrowers typically turn to these loans when in desperate need to pay for an emergency. The vulnerability of these borrowers has sparked regulator's interest.\footnote{In 2013 Mexico's Consumer Protection Bureau (Profeco) is concerned about abuse. It forced Pawnshops to be more transparent in their pricing, register their contracts with them and issued regulation to protect clients. Congress has enacted laws in this regard. \url{http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/ref/lfpc.htm}.} One concern is that borrowers selecting into these loans may exhibit particularly strong behavioral biases. 
%Using a survey conducted by us in branches of Lender $P$, we indeed document some evidence consistent with these concerns: while pawnshop clients predict they will recover their pawn with 93\% probability on average, in reality only 40\% of them do, suggesting naivete. 
%Even conditional on paying a positive amount towards pawn recovery, 53\% lose their pawn and their payment. In our survey 69\% report self-control problems saying they often fall into temptation spending. %, but only gr{15\%} show inter-temporal inconsistencies in a classical present-bias question, a similar number to \cite{Ashaf}. %and {19\%} do not normally budget monthly expenses. 
%While this is suggestive of a present bias problem or overconfidence to save and pay, at the same time our subjects are experienced and not wholly uneducated, 66\% have completed at least high school and 90\% have pawned before. %and {38\%} have participated in a Rosca.

%We implemented a large randomized control trial with close to 10,000 pawnshop clients in 6 branches of Lender $P$ in Mexico City. We answer five main questions using this experiment. First, would clients benefit  ---in terms of recovering their pawn and in terms of incurring in lower financing costs---  from having a frequent (monthly) payment commitment contract \textit{forced} on them, instead of the current 3-month pay-when-you-want contract? That is, we are asking whether \textit{charging} them a 2\% late payment fee for not paying a monthly installment on time can actually \textit{decrease} total (fee-inclusive) financing cost. Second, would there be demand for such an installment contract vis-a-vis the status quo one if given the choice? Note that any payment profile implemented in the commitment contract can be replicated by the borrower under the status quo contract, but the former provides commitment. Third, would clients who benefit from commitment the most (e.g. the present biased or overconfident) demand it more? Fourth, are late payment fees key to provide commitment or would a non-pecuniary but salient personal promise to pay provide a cost-reducing mix of commitment vs flexibility? Promises change behavior significantly in laboratory settings, but we know little about their effect in natural environments.\footnote{%Some papers in this space are \cite{PromisesPartnerships}, \cite{Vanberg}, \cite{Belot2010}, \cite{WhyDoPromises}, \cite{FurtherPromises}, \cite{Ismayilov2017}. 
%There is some actual policy around using promises for loans: the government Mexico has created a program called ``Loans on your word'' for uncollateralized borrowing (\url{http://tiny.cc/yfmnmz}), but unfortunately there is little information about them.} Finally, is \textit{giving choice} among contracts better than forcing clients into payment-commitment contracts in terms of minimizing financing costs incurred and the likelihood of recovering their pawn? Or on the contrary, is it better to force the installment contract paternalistically?

%The experiment involved 5 arms, with randomization happening at the branch-day level. It is described in detail in Section \ref{Experiment}. Here let us briefly explain the main 3 arms. The first one involves a group of clients that were given only the status quo flexible payments contract (henceforth the \textit{status-quo forcing group}). The second arm (\textit{Forced Commitment group}) was given a monthly payment commitment contract, which stipulated that clients had to pay 1/3 of their loan plus accumulated interest in each of the 3 months of the term length. Failing to do this would result in a fee of 2\% of the amount due that month. A third group (\textit{Commitment Choice group}) gave clients a choice between these two contracts. 

%Results are striking. First, we find that forcing clients into frequent payment commitment contracts causes them on average to save on financing cost and to recover their pawn more. The effects are large: financing cost decreases by 9.4\% on average (from \$3157 to \$2860 MXN), while the likelihood of recovering their pawn increases by 26\% (from 43\% to 55\%). Results are robust qualitatively to including transport costs of going to the branch plus losing a day's wage for each visit. Importantly, the benefits are distributed broadly: almost the whole distribution of treatment effects shows cost savings; however those most economically vulnerable, and notably, those we classify as overconfident, experience larger gains. %The commitment contract also causes payments to start 8 days earlier and be 16\% more frequent, compared to the control group. 
%Treatment effects are concentrated in the intensive margin as treatment does not affect the fraction of clients who pay a positive amount towards pawn recovery. That is, the fee-commitment contract induces people who would otherwise pay something towards recovery, to pay more and faster and thus recover their pawn more at a cheaper financial cost. Finally, borrowers assigned to the forced fee-commitment contract are 5 percentage points (100\% of the mean) more likely than the control group to ask for another loan in the future, suggesting that they liked the commitment contract after experiencing it.

%From this first comparison we conclude that penalizing borrowers for delinquency in a contract which has already has large penalties from default actually helps borrowers. In fact, we find that borrowers assigned to the forced fee-commitment contract are 5pp more likely to be repeat costumers, suggesting that they themselves liked the the commitment contract more after experiencing it.\footnote{As it is well known, \textit{naivete} facilitates their exploitation by firms. \cite{Laibson2018} conjectures that this exploitation may be limited if consumers use experienced utility to choose among firms or contracts.}

%Second, in spite of these estimated benefits for almost all clients, actual demand for the fee-commitment contract is low. Only 10\% of the group offered a choice between the monthly payment fee-commitment contract and the status-quo one chose the former. This is not likely driven by misunderstanding the (already simple) contract.\footnote{We posted two project assistants in each of the experimental branches every day for all branch opening hours to carefully explain the contracts; material was developed to explain the differences among the two contracts, and subjects spelled back to our team the loan differences. Furthermore take up is systematically predicted by baseline covariates, making it less likely that these are just random mistakes.} We show further that clients that most benefit from the contract (those who are overconfident about recovering) are \textit{less} likely to demand it, echoing a result by \cite{Sprenger} for grocery purchases and \cite{Walters} for schools. %is Low demand for commitment is consistent with a large literature (\cite{Laibson2015}, \cite{Laibson2018}, \cite{John}, \cite{Ted}, \cite{Rabin2018}). 
%\footnote{\cite{Alcohol} and \cite{Kremer} are some of the few instances of high demand for commitment. \cite{Alcohol} speculates that this difference may be explained by their subjects having more experience with their self control problem. Close to ninety percent of our subjects claim to have pawned before. We find that experience does not predict positive take up in our sample.} 
%\cite{Laibson2015} shows that the lost flexibility resulting from a commitment contract can severely limit take-up when agents are naive about their self control, even though commitment could be welfare improving for them. 
%Owing to this low take-up, we estimate zero average treatment effects of the \textit{Commitment Choice} arm on financial cost and on pawn recovery throughout the quantile distribution.

 %Using boosting we can predict who takes up with 92\% accuracy. This fact shows that the choice among contracts is not purely random.

%Third, combining the forcing and the choice arms ---a unique feature of our experiment--- allows us to estimate the counterfactuals to answer the question of how much money is left on the table by giving choice to clients. We calculate that about {80}\% of clients in the Commitment Choice group chose contracts that induced \textit{higher} financial cost. On average they spend an extra \${238} MXN, close to {11}\% of the average loan value. In particular {92}\% of those that chose the status-quo contract would have been better in the fee-commitment contract, while only {8}\% of those who chose the fee-commitment contract would have been better in the status-quo one. This suggests that forcing clients into commitment contacts ---private paternalism--- may be beneficial for the overwhelming majority of clients. After seeing our results Lender $P$ introduced frequent payment contracts in their loans portfolio.

%Inspired by a significant lab experiment literature on the effects of promises on behavior, and by research showing that a small fee could drastically reduce demand for commitment of (partly) naive present-biased borrowers (\cite{Laibson2015}), we implemented a ``psychological commitment'' product in the form of a salient promise to pay.  \cite{PromisesPartnerships}, \cite{FurtherPromises}, \cite{Vanberg}, and \cite{Ismayilov2017} find that the ability to make a promise about behaving a certain way makes the individual more likely to adhere to the promised behavior. %and also induces trusting behavior by the recipients of the promise. 

%To measure the causal effect of promises we implemented two other treatment arms. A \textit{promise-forcing} arm exactly analogous to our \textit{Forced Commitment arm} except that instead of telling them that there was a fee if they didn't pay on time, we made borrowers promise that they would pay one third of the amount in each of the 3 months, and told them that if they didn't they would have broken their promise and not kept their word. Because salience is key we made them sign a (legally non-binding) personal promise and emphasized that we were counting on them to keep their promise. A final arm (\textit{promise-choice arm}) gave clients the opportunity to choose between the \textit{Promise} contract and the \textit{Status-quo} contract.

%We document three main results in the promise arms. First, demand for the Soft Commitment contract is three times larger than for the fee-commitment contract, with {31}\% take-up. This difference shows that clients are indeed taking into account the contractual parameters when they choose, and that the fee commitment was probably too strong from their point of view. Second, in spite of this much higher take-up, the \textit{Promise-choice arm} had no effect on outcomes on average, or even for those who selected into promising. Third, being forced in to the \textit{Promise} contract also had zero effects on average and throughout the distribution on financing cost and pawn recovery. %\footnote{There is a decrease in financial cost in the 50th and 75th quantiles in the forced Soft Commitment arm however.} Promises did not provide enough commitment so as to be reflected in behavior. This is one of the first  experiments using promises in the field, and results are in striking contrast with those in the lab.

%This paper contributes to several strands of literature. First, we focus on an important new context: pawnshop borrowing. Pawnshop borrowing is extremely prevalent in developing countries and very worrisome to regulators, yet severely understudied.\footnote{The World Bank's CGAP recognizes the importance of pawnshop borrowing worldwide but provides no statistics or analysis on it (\url{https://tinyurl.com/ydgob8pv}). We could not find peer-reviewed papers about it either.} It is different from microfinance in that it deals with emergency loans, and not loans for productive investment. Because of this, it may draw on a more vulnerable (and potentially more unsophisticated) population, and because it is not typically used for productive investment, the trade-off between loan rigidity and investment found for microfinance \citep{Field} may not be there. 

%Second, a significant literature has shown that demand for commitment exists. But while it is low in some contexts (\cite{Ashraf}, \cite{Gine}, \cite{Ted}, \cite{Royer}, \cite{Sprenger}), it is high in others (\cite{Kremer},  \cite{Casaburi}, \cite{Alcohol}, \cite{AprajitP&P}, \cite{Pascaline}). We add to this literature by adding evidence from another market. Demand for commitment  is low, and very small fees\footnote{For instance our fees are 16 times smaller than than those of \cite{John} as a fraction of the loan/goal, and 5 times smaller converting peso values using exchange rates.} are enough to drastically reduce demand for commitment, even when commitment is cost-reducing. Softer commitment contracts in the form of promises do increase demand but did not change outcomes. %We also show that softer commitments in the form of non-pecuniary personal promises elicit higher demand but do not affect behavior or financing costs. 

%Third, and most importantly, we study both causal effects and selection into frequent payment commitment loan contracts at the same time and for the same population in a single experiment. We know of no other experiment in the credit market which simultaneously combines forcing and choice arms. This feature, when paired with new machine learning methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects \citep{atheygrf}, allows us to show whether there is positive or negative selection into beneficial contracts, and whether pawnshop clients forego money by not demanding commitment. In consonance with what \cite{Walters} finds in the school choice context, we find that it is \textit{not} those who benefit most from the contract that demand it more.  \cite{Sprenger} find similar result in the context of grocery purchases. In contrast to \cite{Sprenger}, our context allows us to focus on money savings instead of estimated utility to proxy for benefits of commitment, a narrower but more transparent measure. This allows us to measure effects on cost outcomes beyond take up.\footnote{\cite{John} and \cite{Ted} show that the extent of commitment needed is underestimated. In contrast to them, we infer subjects underestimation of the value of commitment from their forgone treatment savings, instead of from subjects failing to reach a goal.} 

%Third, in consonance with \cite{Sprenger} and \cite{Walters} but in our very different context, we find that people who most need commitment (in our case the overconfident, as they have the larger treatment effects) are also the ones less likely to demand it when given choice. 

%Fourth, we provide new evidence on the payment frequency debate. The literature has found null effects on installment frequency loan default \cite{Pande}. This result is at odds with the prevalence of frequent payment contracts in markets. We find strong effects of payment frequency on decreased default.\footnote{There are many differences in context between the papers which may explain the different result. \cite{Pande} focus on group lending with very little default to start with (less than 1\%), while in our case almost half of loans end in default. We also have a larger sample and we focus on individualized loans, which may afford us stronger statistical power to detect effects.} Our result is consistent with \cite{Field} who show that delaying payment in microfinance loans increases default.\footnote{\cite{Craig} use the discipline of regular loan repayments in microfinance to remind people to save and make a savings plan, and find large increases in savings.} 

%We believe that taken together, our results (commitment matters, small fees have large effects on behavior, people don't choose the cost reducing contract) call for a behavioral explanation. Most of the literature tries to connect commitment problems with measures present biased preferences. Results are mixed, which is not surprising given how hard is to measure present bias naivete for instance. Instead of trying to measure those we focus on measuring biased predictions about payment, what we call overconfidence. Not only is it easier to measure, but also more general in the sense of being implied by present bias but not conversely. As in \cite{Rabin2018} we contrast subjects' \textit{own predictions} of their behavior with their actual behavior, but we do it in a natural setting. \cite{Murdoch} show that a robust positive correlation exists between displaying present biased preferences in surveys and selecting into microfinance, which they interpret as being due to high demand for the discipline imposed by frequent payments. However they acknowledge that this ``interpretation is suggestive... and needs to be confirmed by studies that establish causal links''. Our experiment is a test of this causal link.



%\cite{Ghatak} state that ``high-frequency repayment, a feature in nearly all microfinance contracts, has been largely overlooked''. %\footnote{\cite{LittleAtAtime} also note that ``it is especially surprising that there is so little analytical discussion of the incentive effects of the installment system''.} 
%This paper fills part of this gap. 


%Finally, even though personal promises feature prominently in microfinance guidelines\footnote{e.g. \url{https://grameenfoundation.org/documents/GrameenGuidelines.pdf}, p.36.} we know of no other study that has tried to isolate their effects on loan repayment.  In concordance with this literature we find that people are willing and indeed voluntarily choose to make promises. We find however that measured behavior was unchanged by promising.\footnote{This is of course not a refutation of the laboratory literature. %not least because the laboratory literature is implemented on more tightly controlled environments and focused on subtler aspects of promising, like their effects on second order beliefs and guilt aversion. The context is also different since The lab literature has focused on very structured investment games between two players and looked at the effects of promises on trust and cooperation. In our case the bank is not a strategic player that responds to the promise, or a person to which the client can feel guilt towards (although the teller is). However, our results do provide a first piece of evidence on the limitations of using promises to change behavior in loan contracts.}

%, consistent with a significant fraction of clients displaying naivete about self control problems (see \cite{Rabin2018}). Our context is one in which private paternalism (\cite{Laibson2018}) could work since almost all pawnshop clients would benefit from frequent payment contract yet there it almost no demand for them. After our experiment ended, Lender P started to tie in installment payment components to some of their contracts themselves.


%\footnote{This is consistent with \cite{Belot2010}, who emphasize that elicited promised may have lower effects than voluntary ones.}
%\cite{Rabin2018} and \cite{Ted} show that naivete may lead to the choice of to little commitment. 
%Before discussing results, let us mention why these questions are relevant and how they relate to the literature. Most of microfinance involves frequent payments/meeting with the group --sometimes weekly-- even though this increases transaction costs. Several hypothesis have been postulated to explain this, from increased group's cohesion and monitoring, to forming personal payment habits or serving as a commitment device. Most of the literature (e.g. \cite{Pande}) find however null effects of increasing frequency on default, and therefore on payment habits, commitment, or peer pressure.  

%The paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{context} provides context and describes the data sources. Section \ref{Data} presents summary statistics and defines our main outcome variables. Section \ref{Experiment} describes the experiment and shows pre-treatment balance across arms. Section \ref{fee-commitment} estimates the effect of forcing clients into the fee-commitment contract, while Section \ref{Commitment Choice} studies the effects of choice. Section \ref{model} collects all findings and presents a model to rationalize them qualitatively. Section \ref{promises} assesses if promises work in our context as commitment devices. Finally, Section \ref{conclusion} concludes.


\section{Context} \label{context}

\subsection{Pawnshop borrowing}
    
Pawn loans involve individuals leaving valuable and liquid assets, typically jewelry, as collateral in exchange for an immediate cash loan. Collateral is typically larger than the loan, which allows lenders to skip the checking of credit history and give the loan immediately. This makes pawn loans a popular way to get cash to pay for emergencies. In fact, they are one of the most prevalent forms of borrowing. There are more than 11,000 pawn shops across the US, with 30 million clients and \$14 billion yearly revenues.\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/ybm56dpe}, \url{https://tinyurl.com/y9zdcgws}, \url{https://tinyurl.com/y59ptdam}.} Our partner pawn lender alone served more than 1 million clients in the last 3 years with more than 4 million contracts. For comparison there were 2.3 million micro-finance clients across all lenders in Mexico in 2009 \citep{Pedroza:2010}. 

Pawning is also one of the oldest forms of borrowing. Pawn lending existed in antiquity at least since the Roman Empire, and there are records of it in China about 1,500 years ago \citep{PawnShops}. In spite of the high prevalence and long history, pawnshop borrowing has not received much attention in the economics literature. The closest product widely studied is payday loans. In developing countries, however, payday lending is likely small compared to pawnshop lending; the latter is faster and requires less documentation, allowing access to informal sector workers who receive their salaries in cash. According to \cite{Payday} to get a payday loan: ``All that a prospective borrower typically needs is a home address; a valid checking account; a driver’s license and Social Security number; a couple of pay stubs to verify employment; wages and pay dates; and minimum earnings of at least \$1,000 a month''. Although the author meant this list as an instance of low requirements, they would render virtually all poor households in the developing countries ineligible. 


%Lender $P$ was interested in understanding why half of their clients lost their pawn. Default is high in this context  compared to many papers in the microfinance literature.\footnote{\cite{Pande} study of the effect of payment frequency in a context where the rate of default is close to 1\%.} 


As with payday lending, pawnshop lending is controversial. Regulators have concerns with the sophistication of borrowers using it. The US congress has actually banned the payday lending industry from serving active military personnel, and some States in the US have imposed zoning restrictions, interest caps, and restrictions on serial borrowing as consumer protection measures against payday lending \citep{Payday}. The main source of concern is whether consumers that use these loans suffer from behavioral and cognitive biases which imply sub-optimal choices. There is some evidence  in support of this view.\footnote{\cite{Bertrand} write that ``Under the view that the people borrowing from payday lenders are making an informed, utility-maximizing choice given the constraints that they face, one  would not expect additional information disclosure about the payday product to  alter their borrowing behavior'', but to the contrary they find that simply disclosing how financing costs add up reduced demand by 11\%. \cite{Meltzer} finds that payday loan access leads to increased difficulty paying mortgage, rent and utilities bills.}   Our study reinforces the idea that a lack of sophistication may be an integral part of that way that standard pawn contracts are structured.



\subsection{Status Quo Pawn Contracts}

To study this market, we partnered with one of the largest pawn shops in Mexico, an institution with more than one hundred branches spanning multiple States in Mexico. This lender (whom we refer to as `Lender P') has a simple and typical business model. They take gold jewelry as collateral in exchange for a fraction the value of the piece, in cash. No other collateral and no credit history checks are needed. The transaction takes less than 10 minutes and is conducted at the branch in person between the client and the appraiser (i.e. a teller, see Figure \ref{PawnshopPicture}). The appraiser weighs the gold piece and runs tests on its purity. Based on these she assigns a gold value to the piece, stores it as collateral, and gives 70\% of the gold value of the piece in cash to the client. The borrower signs a 2-page contract with the conditions of the loan and leaves with the cash.

Lender P had only one type of contract, henceforth the \textit{status quo} contract. It stipulated that the interest rate was 7\% \textit{per month} compounded daily on the outstanding amount of the loan. The loan had a 90 days term with 15 days' grace period, and the client could make payments at anytime with no penalty for pre-payment. No reminders or interim contact exists between the lender and the borrower.  If the client returns to pay the principal plus the accumulated interest within 105 days, she received back her pawn, otherwise the pawnbroker kept the piece and any payments made. Before the contract expired, the client had the right to renew it  using the same collateral for another 3 months by going to the pawnshop paying the accumulated interest and signing a new contract with exactly the same terms as the original one.  26\% of borrowers renew at least once with a given pawn. This contract was standard in the industry.  


The clients that pawned understood these terms well (as we verified in interviews). \footnote{90\% of clients report in our survey that they have pawned before.} These clients have little or no access to other types of loans and they value the convenience of pawn borrowing.  This population of pawn borrowers is economically vulnerable:  30\% of them could not pay either water, electricity \& gas or rent in the past 6 months. They often receive negative income shocks: 87\% said they are pawning because of an emergency, and only 13\% stated it was to use in a `non-urgent expense'.  When asked why they are pawning this piece 5\% responded `lost a family member', `a medical emergency' (11\%), or `an urgent expense' (71\%).


Our context is also one with high borrower default: 60\% of clients lose their pawn in a time span of 230 days from the date of pawning.   One potential explanation for high default is that clients are really just knowingly selling their gold piece through a pawn contract on which they intend to default. This appears unlikely for several reasons: (a) clients can easily sell the gold and obtain a higher amount of instant cash at gold buying stores located close to almost all our pawnshop branches (see Figure \ref{GoldBuyers}), (b) the reported subjective value of the pawn is larger than the loan size for 86\% of clients, (c) among those that lose their pawn 48\% paid a positive amount towards its recovery and on average paid 42\% of the value of their loan (see Figure \ref{proxy_naive} in Appendix) --- this can only be rationalized if they expected to recover their pawn, and (d) 74\% of borrowers report a 100\% probability of repaying their loan (and 98\% at least a 50\% chance of repaying) in our baseline our baseline survey at the time they take the loan.  So it does appear that a large share of default is not `planned' in a simple ex-ante sense.  High default could be also detrimental from the lender's point of view since it may reduce the likelihood that the client becomes a return costumer. Lender P was explicitly interested in  partnering with us to investigate whether a frequent payment contract would increase pawn recovery, costumer satisfaction, and repeat borrowing, and to explore whether there was demand for such a contract. 


Pawnshops therefore makes money in three ways: by reselling the jewelry left as collateral on defaulted loans, by charging interest on non defaulted loans, and by keeping the payments made on defaulted loans. In this way the interest rate typically used to calculate borrower APRs is thus a very inadequate measure of the effective cost of pawn loans.

    
\subsection{Measurement of the Cost to Pawning} \label{costs}
    
We now develop the measures of net financial costs to the borrower that are used as our core pecuniary outcomes.  The two key measures are loan default, and the effective financial cost incurred by the borrower. Default is defined as losing the pawn. Let $P^c$, $P^f$, and $P^i$ the payments to principal, fees, and interest respectively. We define financial cost as the sum of payments toward the loan, plus the payment of fees, plus payments to interest, plus the appraised value of the pawn when the borrower falls into default: 
\begin{align*}
    Financial \; Cost_i =& \underbrace{\sum_t P^c_{it}}_{\text{Payments to capital}} + \underbrace{\sum_t P^f_{it}}_{\text{Payments of fees}}  +\underbrace{\sum_t P^i_{it}}_{\text{Payments to interests}} \\
    &\quad\qquad + \underbrace{\mathds{1}(Default_i) \times Pawn \: Value_i}_{\text{Cost of losing pawn}}
\end{align*}

\noindent $t$ indexes days, and $\mathds{1}(Default_i)$ is an indicator function for defaulting\footnote{This cost is calculated for a time period of 230 days after loan origination.}. We also report results using the subjective value of the pawn reported by the borrower in place of the appraised value, and a measure of financial cost that adds the travel expense, since the main treatment involves making clients come to the branch to pay each month.

As a second measure of cost we use the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of the previous Financial Cost. In particular, the APR is defined to be the rate that solves the following amortization equation for a 3 period monthly payment:


\begin{align*}
    \frac{Financial\;Cost_i}{3} =& Appraised\; Value_i \times \frac{\frac{APR}{100(12)}\left(1+\frac{APR}{100(12)}\right)^3}{\left(1+\frac{APR}{100(12)}\right)^3-1}     
\end{align*}



We can use the control group for the study to present summary statistics on these core measures of default and financial cost.  Figure \ref{fc_pro_2_115} reports results using only the first 115 days. Figure \ref{fc_hist}(a) plots a histogram of this financial cost in pesos for loans where the pawn was either recovered or lost, while panel (b) shows the APR. It shows that most of the cost comes from clients that do not recover their pawn. 
%Of those who renew, 83\% lose the pawn. Figure \ref{fc_hist}(a) suggest that financial cost is significant, even for those that do recover their pawn. Panel (b) normalizes the cost by loan size. It shows that as a percentage of their pawn, most of the cost comes from clients that do not recover their pawn. For them the cost is between 140\% and 250\% of the loan value. %{The difference between panel (a) and (b) arises since clients who lose their pawn tend to be those that pledge cheaper pieces.} 


%We calculate an APR of 218\% on average for the control group.%\footnote{The Annual Percentage Rate (for pawn $j$) is calculated as the internal rate of return $i$ such that $\sum_t \frac{P_{jt}}{(1+i)^t} + \frac{\text{I}(Default \: Pawn_j) \times Pawn \: Value_j}{(1+i)^T} - Pawn \: Value_j = 0$, where $T$ is the date the pawn was lost, and $P_{jt} =P_{jt}^c+P_{jt}^f+P_{jt}^i $ is the sum of all payments.}



\section{Experimental Design} \label{Experiment}

\subsection{Treatment arms and randomization}


\noindent \textbf{The Commitment Contract.} For the purpose of the experiment we designed a new contract that is identical to the status quo contract except that, informed by the behavioral literature on the ways to improve repayment in credit contracts, it enhances the regularity and salience of payments. It has the same interest rate (7\% \textit{per month}) which accumulates daily on outstanding debt, it has the same loan size/collateral ratio (70\%), it has the same loan term (90 days, and a grace period of 15 days), and the gold pawn gets appraised in the same way by the same appraisers. The Commitment contract however requires the client to make regular monthly payments for the duration of the contract, with the principal and interest payments split evenly across the three months of the contract (day 30, 60 and 90 after loan disbursement). The importance of this monthly payment was reinforced in two ways; first by reminders issued to any borrower delinquent on the monthly payments that they were supposed to be made, and secondly by the levying of a nominal fee (2\% of minimum due) that would be levied on individuals behind in their payments.\footnote{This fee was set by the lender, being deemed to be large enough to reinforce commitment but small enough that if clients had an emergency and could not pay, the fee would not cause the pawn to be unrecoverable.  In contrast with \cite{John} we don't let the clients choose the size of the fee. That paper shows that doing this results in wrong choices by (partially) naive present biased consumers. Our fee is much smaller than the median in her experiment, as explained in the introduction. %We also experimented with a contract where there was no pecuniary fee for paying late but where we clients made a personal promise to pay monthly.
}


As is typical in the behavioral literature we include an arm that allows borrowers to opt in to the commitment contract if they choose.  If, however, a lack of sophistication is an issue with borrowers in pawn contracts, then this process of self-selection may not assign commitment to the `right' people.  To examine this issue, we include an arm  that assigns all individuals to the commitment contract so that we are able in essence to form three counterfactual outcomes; no commitment, commitment, and the chosen commitment.  This design allows us to investigate the repercussions of choice not only for those who \textit{do} choose (as is the case in a standard LATE design), but also the implications of choice for those who \textit{do not} choose.  This turns out to be key for what we can learn from this experiment.  

In order to explore lower-cost forms of structure, we also include arms that feature `soft' commitment, asking or requiring individuals to follow the more regular payment structure of the commitment contract but then providing no reminders or repercussions for failing to do so.  A substantial literature documents that people are averse to to breaking their promises, and are willing to incur in monetary losses in trying to keep them. This provides a potentially very attractive way to drive better repayment behavior at low pecuniary cost to clients.  Numerous lab experiments and at least one field experiment on financial services show that such soft commitment can work \citep{Craig}.\footnote{Grameen Bank for instance makes clients recite a promise at each center weekly meeting.The exact promise repeated by clients live is this: ``\textit{We pledge to attend regularly the weekly Center meetings, to utilize our loans for the purpose approved, to save and pay our installments weekly, to use our increased incomes for the benefit of our families, to ensure that other members of our group and Center do likewise and to take collective responsibility if they do not.''}}  The soft treatments mimic the commitment arms as closely as possible without imposing external remainders or pecuniary consequences for failing to meet terms.

\vspace{.2in}
\noindent \textbf{Treatment Arms.} Randomization was done at the branch-day level. Each day a computer randomly assigned which types of contracts were on offer that day in the branch, and therefore which contract the client signed.  We have 5 different experimental arms: 


\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Control} arm: consisted of branch-days offering the status quo contract described in Section \ref{context}, and only this contract. 
    \item \textit{Forced Commitment} arm: consisted of branch-days requiring all borrowers to use the Commitment contract described above.  
    \item \textit{Commitment Choice} arm: consisted of branch-days offering the client \textit{a choice} between the Commitment contract, and the status quo contract.
    \item \textit{Forced Soft Commitment} arm: consisted of branch-days in which borrowers were asked to sign a non-binding written commitment to pay monthly as in the Commitment contract, but no reminders or fees were imposed if they did not.\footnote{The client was made to sign a paper which said ``I promise to pay every month the corresponding sum of \_\_\_\_\_\_, on the dates \_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_. This is \underline{not} a legal document and cannot be used in courts. It is just a \textit{personal promise}. If I do not comply I will not have kept my word''. After signing, the promise was read to the client by the appraiser.}%\footnote{Our setting does not allow us to separate if the client is making a promise to the bank teller or whether she is mentally interpreting this as an internal promise to herself as a goal. We thank Anett John for pointing this out.}
    \item \textit{Soft Commitment Choice} arm: consisted of branch-days on which the client was given \textit{a choice} between the Soft Commitment and the status quo contract.
\end{enumerate}

We did not allocate equal number of days across arms, since we were interested in having more power in some of them. The number of branch days allocated to each were 84, 80, 93, 68, and 82, respectively.  See Figure \ref{exp_description} for a CONSORT-style diagram of the study design and recruitment.


\vspace{.2in}
\noindent \textbf{Randomization.}  Starting September 6, 2012, we implemented the experiment in 6 branches of Lender $P$. The branches were selected by Lender $P$ to be dispersed across Mexico City and have varying sizes. In four of them the experiment ran for 107 days, and in 2 of them we ran it for a shorter time to economize on data collection costs once we realized we would not be constrained by sample size. %Thus we eliminated {the smallest} ones. 
Branches are more than 5 km apart from each other, and there is little substitution among them; only 1\% of consumers appear in more than one of our branches.


 Branch personnel did not know which treatment would happen on which day. They were told that there were 5 different ``types of contract-days'' and that the system chose randomly which applied on any given date, and that it could happen for instance that two consecutive dates had the same contract. They were also told that this way of operating was in place in various Lender P's branches (they did not know which ones), and that it could be in place for several months. Randomizing at the day level limits the problem of contamination arising from clients realizing that other clients get different contracts than theirs. It also limits potential manipulation by appraisers, who in the presence of individual level randomization could potentially pick their preferred costumers from the line or tell them to wait until their desired contract shows up on the screen. Intra-branch day correlation on the probability of default (ICC) is small, at {0.08}, so we lose little power vis-a-vis individual-level randomization.



Panel (b) of Figure \ref{exp_description} shows how many contracts the experiment has in each arm (rectangles). And for the choice arms, it displays in blue how many people actually chose the respective commitment contract.



For the experiment to be meaningful, it is critical that clients understood the contract terms clearly.  To ensure this, we built two `check-points'.  First, two enumerators were present in each branch for the whole day during the duration of our experiment to explain the contract terms to clients. One of the aspects emphasized was that the frequent payment contract involved the commitment to pay \underline{each month} a third of the outstanding amount, and the nature of the reminders and fees associated with the Commitment arm.  Figure \ref{ExplanatoryMaterial} translates a piece of the materials we used to explain the contracts (in this case a comparison sheet used in the Promise-Choice days to compare contracts terms side to side). The explanation took about 3-5 minutes and was pursued until the client said she understood the contract terms. Enumerators then asked clients to explain back the contract terms and corrected any misunderstandings. 

The second check-point was that before the clients signed the contract, the appraiser made them read them the ``Contract Terms Summary'' sheet shown in Figure \ref{PaperSlip}. It was a piece of paper given to clients after their piece had been appraised and the size of the loan determined, but before they signed their contract. The appraiser read it and asked the client to sign it as a proof of understating. %The sheet clearly indicates that this contract is a monthly payment one (numeral 1), that there is a penalty of 2\% for paying late (numeral 2), and the 3 payment dates (numeral 3). 
Finally, the bottom of the Figure \ref{PaperSlip} shows the paper slip we used for the promise arms. The clients had to put their name on a slip of paper where they stated they promised to pay monthly.

We are confident the overwhelming majority of clients understood the contracts and made informed choices. As shown below, different contract terms did generate differential demand and differential behavior. Moreover, we can systematically predict demand based on consumer characteristics and measured beliefs.






\subsection{Survey Data and Summary Statistics}

The study exploits two forms of data; administrative data from the lender and a short survey we conducted of experimental clients.  



The administrative data contains a unique identifier for the client, an identifier for the piece she is pawning, and the transactions relating to that piece. In particular, the value of the piece as assessed by the appraiser, the amount of money loaned (70\% of the value), the date of the pawn transaction, and the type of contract for that pawn. Within the period of the loan, we followed each transaction related to that piece in the administrative data: when payments were made and for what amounts, whether there was default (i.e. the client lost her pawn), and whether any late-payment fees were imposed. After the experimental loan, we are able to track subsequent behavior and to see whether that borrower took a subsequent loan.  We have this information for all the pawns that occurred in the experiment's 6 branches between August 2, 2012 and August 13, 2013, this includes all the pawns under our experiment but also those that happened 1 month before it started and up to 8 months after it ended. Figure \ref{exp_description} shows the design and timing of the experiment, along with the sample sizes in each arm. The experiment comprises 13,446 pawns, and our administrative data cover a total of 23,974 pawn




In addition, we had a team of enumerators in each branch collect surveys and clearly explain the contract terms to walk-in clients. The enumerators were inside the branch and asked clients to complete a 5 minute survey \textit{before} going to the teller window to appraise their piece and before they were told contract terms (i.e. before treatment status was known). It was short to avoid discouraging the potential clients from pawning, but at the same time it aimed to measure the following: demographics, proxies for income/wealth, education, self-control problems/present-biased preferences, experience pawning, if family or friends commonly asked for money, how time consuming and costly it was to come to the branch, the subjective probability of recovering the piece that they intended to pawn, the subjective value of their piece in money terms (how much money they would sell it for), among others. We surveyed 10,437 clients, and the survey response rate is 78\%.\footnote{The Appendix \ref{baseline_survey} transcribes the questionnaire in English.} %\footnote{We also surveyed clients before and after the experiment, so our survey covers a larger sample that we are not using in this paper.}. 





\subsection{Attrition}

The study is subject to two potential forms of attrition.  The more serious is that clients would change their pawning decisions in response to the treatment arms.  If this were the case, our study would still recover internally valid estimates of the impacts of the treatment arms for the lender, but would not provide \textit{ceteris paribus} impacts on a comparable pool of individuals. We anticipated this possibility and trained appraisers to say --that whatever was the contract that day-- it was the only available contract for an undetermined amount of time.   Because we do not observe refusals directly, we address this issue by examining the number of borrowers per day, with specific attention to whether the Forced Commitment arm led to a lower number of borrowers per day.\footnote{Our enumerators informed us that potential clients rarely left the branch without pawning, and that it was even less common that they did so when hearing about monthly installments. Lender P also never complained to us that our different treatments were hurting sales. The data support this story as well.}




A second form of attrition would be differential refusal to answer the survey questions.  This is less of a concern, both because the survey was done before treatment status was revealed, and because we still have institutional data for the universe of borrowers.  Nonetheless, to test the internal validity of any measures in the study that use survey data, we test for differential attrition here as well.  A third way of examining attrition is to look at the fraction of borrowers who do respond to the survey and then do not end up taking a loan subsequent to completing the survey.






Table \ref{attrition_table} presents tests for these core forms of attrition.  Most importantly, the top row shows that there is no difference between the Control and Forced Commitment arms in terms of the number of pawns per day, suggesting that there has been no differential refusal when borrowers were defaulted into the Commitment contract.  The Choice arm appears to have a somewhat larger number of borrowers than the Control arm, but given that there is no reason to think that we would have seen differential uptake for this arm (where the status quo contract is freely available) we view this as a chance occurrence.  The survey response rate is broadly similar across arms (about 77 percent) as is the fraction of those surveyed who then go on to take a loan (97 percent).  



Finally, we also tested if the number of pawns per day for the 6 branches that participated in the experiment was different 1 month before the experiment started or 1 month after the experiment ended, relative to the days the experiment was active. To this end we estimated the regression\footnote{We cluster the standard errors by branch.} $Pawns \: per \: day_{jt} = \alpha_j + \gamma f(t) + \beta_b \mathbbm{1}(t \in MB)_{t} +\beta_a \mathbbm{1}(t \in MA)_{t}$, where $\alpha_j$ are branch fixed effects, $f(t)$ is a third degree polynomial in time, $\beta_b$ measures a level effect in the number of pawns per branch a month before the experiment started, and $\beta_a$ a month after. We estimate no difference in the number of pawns, showing that people are not leaving the branch without pawning at larger rates during the experiment ($\beta_a=1.32$, $\beta_b=-0.65$, with p-values 0.11 and 0.83, respectively).  Table \ref{num_pawns_bal} shows the beta coefficients from these regressions, which are nowhere significant.  Hence we begin the analysis confident that differential attrition has not occurred.  








%\subsection{Connection to the literature}
%Our study connects with two strands of the literature on microfinance. But also to a nascent one that uses RCTs to study to what extent people self-sort to treatments that have larger beneficial treatment effects for them. On the microfinance literature the first paper we could find that used an RCT to evaluate the causal effect of frequent payments in loans is \cite{Pande}. In a group lending rosca context, they note that most contracts involved frequent repayments --even weekly in many instances-- even when this increases transaction costs. They note that clients could benefit from ``the fiscal discipline afforded by the more rigid payments''. Frequency could provide a commitment device for clients, could foster a payment habit, or could generate more trust from social interactions among the group of borrowers. All these potential benefits apply in our context, except those relating to social interactions, as we work with individualized loans.

\subsection{Balance in the Experimental Sample}
Table \ref{SS} presents summary statistics for the sample of actual borrowers across arms, and illustrates that randomization worked to achieve balance across clients in the different experimental arms. 

Panel A uses administrative data for the universe of borrowers in each arm, and shows that loan balances and the days on the week on which individuals pawned are comparable across arms.  The average loan size is \$2197 MXN (\$105 USD).


Panel B of Table \ref{SS} reports summary statistics across arms from our survey data. 73\% of clients are women, with an average age of 43 years; 66\% of them have completed high school or more, and 90\% have pawned before, so that our sample has mostly experienced borrowers. Finally the subjective probability of recovery is close to 93\% on average, which makes a stark contrast to the actual rate of recovery (42\%).  In other words, borrowers are highly overconfident on average. The average subjective value they report for the pieces is 3069 MXN, much larger than the average appraised gold value of 2197 MXN.  While this could arise either from overconfidence in valuation or from undervaluation by the lender, in any case it is \textit{prima facie} evidence that loss of the pawn should be undesirable relative to the quantity of liquidity leveraged by the asset. 

Panel C repeats the exercise in Panel B, but now only for those borrowers answered the survey and then went on to take a loan.  Since we have aready shown that the attrition rate of borrowers after completing the survey was very low (3\% on average) it is unsurprising that these two panels are similar.  Overall, we find both the loan attributes and the survey attributes of borrowers to be similar across arms.  The experiment appears to have been successful in generating a balanced sample for analysis.





%Panel A describes variables from the administrative data.  The average number of pawns per day per branch is 34. Only 42\% of clients recover their pawn. Even those that recover their pawn tend to pay it back at the last moment, with only 40\% paying before the 90th day.

 


\section{Experimental Analysis} \label{experiment}


\subsection{Forced versus Chosen Commitment} \label{forced_vs_choice}



The comparison of the Commitment Choice arm to the Control arm provides the test of self-selection that is standard in the behavioral literature.  A lack of impact in this comparison would be consistent either with a population of neo-classical borrowers, for whom the commitment feature is superfluous, or with a population of time-inconsistent borrowers who lack sophistication over their own behavioral problems and so do not choose commitment even though they would benefit from it.  The keys to distinguishing these two stories is the treatment effect of commitment on those who would not choose it; this counterfactual is revealed through the additional impact of the Forced Commitment arm over the Choice arm.  So while the forcing of commitment cuts against the grain of a behavioral literature that has largely promoted `nudges', it reveals important additional information that may be particularly relevant in borrower populations that are both hyperbolic and naive.


In the Choice arm, only 11\% of individuals offered the product selected it. This is initial evidence either that we are dealing with a population of largely time consistent individuals who do not need commitment, or of a population with many naive individuals who do not know that they need it.  If this self-selection mechanism works perfectly (as it would in a Roy model with all hyperbolics sophisticated) then the Forced and Choice arms will have an identical effect.  Deviations between the impacts of these two arms therefore are implicitly a test of the optimality of the choices made in the choice arm.  


We pose these comparative questions using the standard pooled experimental equation (\ref{basic_reg}):

\begin{equation} \label{basic_reg}
    y_{ij} = \alpha + \beta^F T_{i}^F + \beta^C T_{i}^C + \gamma X_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $i$ refers to client, $j$ indexes branch, $T_{i}^F$ and $T_{i}^C$ are indicator variables for receiving the Forced or Choice arms, $X_{ij}$ are branch and day-of-week fixed effects.\footnote{There is a minority of of clients that pawned again and got assigned a different treatment. Results are robust to excluding them, or to using only the first treatment status assigned, as we show later.  In the main regressions we include them and add a dummy indicating clients who has more than one treatment in the experimental period.} We cluster errors at the branch-day level, the unit of treatment assignment. %\footnote{If we restrict ourselves to pieces that fall in a single-arm (64\%), then treatment reduces the financial cost by 5.7\%, increases the likelihood of recovering their pawn by 35\%, and increases the likelihood of repeat business by 66\%.}.
Our main outcome variables $y_{ij}$ are measures of financial cost in pesos as defined in Section \ref{costs}, which we further decompose into its component costs:  payments to capital, fees, interest, and the cost of losing the pawn.  We then examine an indicator variable for client $i$ losing her pawn.  Next we cast each of the cost drivers as an effective Annual Percentage Rate (APR), including the costs of lost collateral under default as a component of the overall APR of pawn borrowing.  $\beta^F$ estimates the Average Treatment Effect of the Forced arm (since compliance is 100\%), and  $\beta^C$ the Intention to Treat of the Choice arm (since it is not).





%Defenders of choice make another subtler point: that even if take up of the commitment-fee contract is low, the sole fact of \textit{having} choice could potentially change behavior or welfare (\cite{Dalboetal:2010}, \cite{Sjostrometal:2018}, \cite{Tlaxcala}).

%In spite of broadly distributed benefits of the Forced Commitment commitment contract we documented above, 90\% of clients chose \textit{not} to have it, preferring the status-quo contract. As explained above we are fairly confident this was not because a lack of understanding of the contracts. 

%\vspace{.1in}
%\noindent What can explain this low demand? In the spirit of \cite{Blumenstock} we try to differentiate between explanations. One explanation could be risk. Even if the fee forcing contract generates cost savings on average, clients with risk averse preferences may not demand it if they perceive higher risk from it.   Alternatively, even risk-neutral agents may not demand it if the cost of lost flexibility is high or if they have high temporal discount rates and prefer to pay later. %If clients, for instance, face large and frequent income shocks which make it hard to repay monthly.\footnote{We don't observe income shocks in our data, making is hard to quantify how important they are. 91\% of those in the Forced Commitment arm incurred a fee, which suggests that shocks are not uncommon.} 
%Although the evidence that follows undermines several explanations, the tests we can conduct given the data are not sharp enough to leave a single explanation standing. Section \ref{model} lays our a simple theory (namely present bias with partial naivete) which fits all the 6 main findings of the paper. Given its parsimony and explanatory power, we submit that it is the most suitable explanation for our results.

%\subsection{The effect of choice on pawn recovery and financial cost} \label{effect_choice}






The core results, presented in Table \ref{main_impact_table} and Figure \ref{main_te}, are extremely stark.  The Choice arm fails to deliver significant changes in any measure (with the exception of an increase in fees, for which we are highly powered since this outcome is zero by definition in the control).  In sharp contrast, the Forced Commitment arm yields strongly significant decreases in the financial cost of loans to clients.  Despite causing an increase in payments to capital and fees, the Forced arm leads to a sharp decrease in overall costs of borrowing, driven by a 12 percentage point decrease in the probability of default (more than a 25\% reduction off a base of 44\% default).  The bottom panel of the figure casts these costs as APRs, and shows that while the Choice arm actually leads to a slight \textit{increase} in the APR, the Forced arm decreases the effective annualized interest cost of pawn lending by 40 percentage points.  A credit product that has an effective average APR of 249\% in the status quo arm (inclusive of default) is reduced to a cost of 209\% through the imposition of a more regularized payment structure.  

Table \ref{main_impact_table} decomposes the savings from the Forced and Choice arms into their component parts. The Forced arm increases fees very significantly relative to a control mean of 0, but the monetary value of the fees imposed is small (28 pesos).  Payments towards capital also rise by 167 pesos because the arm is so effective at improving the fraction of individuals actually repaying their loans.  Because the regular repayment structure moves the timing of payment forward it saves borrowers an average of 109 pesos in interest costs.  The very large majority of the overall treatment effect, however, stems from the 492 pesos in retained collateral value induced by the falling probability of default. 


Figure \ref{main_te} represents the  effect sizes (in standard deviations) of the two main study arms for three outcomes:  default, the financial cost of the loan, and the effective interest rate paid to acquire the borrowed capital.  The Forced arm is significant for all three outcomes, with very substantial treatment effects in magnitudes for default and APR, and the commitment arm is never significant.\footnote{The slight increase in APR for the Choice arm seen in this picture arises from the fact that the APR calculation has the arm-specific loan size in the denominator, and the loans in the Choice arm turn out to be slightly smaller (although statistically equal) on average than the Control.}    In other words, voluntary commitment is ineffective but the use of forced commitment saves the average borrower an amount of money almost twice the APR of a normal US credit card loan.  




Other intermediate outcomes are impacted by assignment to frequent payments. Table \ref{mechanisms} shows that the first payment happens 8 days earlier in the Forced Commitment arm than in status quo (column 1), and that the number of payments increases by 0.19 (column 4). Treatment effects are concentrated on the intensive margin, as treatment does \textit{not} affect the fraction of clients who pay nothing (column 12). The percentage of the loan paid increases by 9 percentage points on average (column 9). Moreover, the percentage of the loan paid is even smaller for those that end up losing the pawn (first row of column 9). This last point is critical; this intervention has the potential to do financial harm if it caused individuals to increase fruitless payments on loans for which they would end up defaulting.  This result shows that the Forced arm drives individuals who would otherwise have made partial payment and defaulted to instead recover their pawn.


Can subjective perceptions of the loan, such as perceived collateral value, discounting, or the opportunity cost of time, rationalize these results?  Figure \ref{robustness_fc} shows the results of these robustness checks, and the numbers underlying the figure are shown in Table \ref{table_robustness_fc}.  First, rather than using the appraised value of the pawn from the lender, we can assess costs using the subjective value of the pawn reported by the borrower.  Because borrower valuations are both larger on average and much more variable, this adjustment causes the average impact on financial cost to rise, and the impact on APR in standard deviations to shrink, but both remain significant.   Second, because the Commitment contract requires more frequent visits to the branch, there are travel costs incurred relative to the status quo payment structure that we can include in the costs of commitment.  For each visit we add the self-reported transport cost (or the mean if we are missing this from the individual survey) plus a whole day's wage, multiplied by the number of additional visits from Table \ref{mechanisms}. Adding a whole day's wage may exaggerate cost, but we still observe a reduction of this more comprehensive measure of cost caused by the frequent payment contract. Finally, we can adjust for the fact that the early payment induced by the commitment contract actually reduces the effective liquidity received by borrowers.  Taking the interest rate as the opportunity cost of capital, the interest payments averted are not really `saved' given that the liquidity is itself foregone.  So our final adjustment removes the saved interest payments from the calculation of the benefits across arms.  The figure shows the effects of each of these adjustments on the estimate of financial cost and APR, and illustrates that even when we make all of these adjustment simultaneously the Forced arm generates benefits of 0.11 standard deviations, significant at the 95\% level.  Hence forcing individuals into commitment generates benefit even when we incorporate multiple subjective dimensions of the loan.




Another way to push the analysis towards a consideration of borrower welfare is the conjecture that if clients exposed to the installment contract like it, they will be more likely to come back vis-a-vis those that got status quo contract.\footnote{\cite{Laibson2018} hypothesizes that consumers use ``experienced utility'' as a guide to make future purchases in this way.} This is indeed what we find in the data.  We consider this outcome in Table \ref{repeat_loans}.  We can first ask whether the individual ever takes a loan after the initial study loan, an analysis which is simply experimental.  The results show that the Choice arm is no more likely to pawn again, which the Forced arm is 6\% more likely to take a second loan.  While this appears to be \textit{prima facie} evidence of greater satisfaction with the lender, interpretation here is complicated by the fact that they were more likely to have recovered their pawn and hence to be able to pawn it again.  We can explore this possibility in a number of ways.  First, we can (endogenously) split the sample according to whether the individual defaulted on the experimental loan; here we find that the increase in subsequent borrowing is restricted to those who repaid the first one.  Then, we can examine whether the probability that they take another loan using different collateral from the first, and while not significant we find that the Forced arm elevates the probability of re-pawning with new collateral.  We can also separately examine the likelihood to take a new loan after the contract period of the original experimental loan (column 5) or after it (column 6) and we find that the increase in subsequent pawning is coming afterwards, significantly increasing the time to the subsequent loan (column 7).  

\textcolor{red}{Figure \ref{prob_ever_pawn} provides a visual take on the probability of re-pawning as a function of original treatment status.}


%Although we have shown that Forced Commitment reduces financial cost and increases pawn recovery, this does not imply that welfare increases. Clients could have disutility from the stress of having monthly installments for instance. 
%We don't need to make the strong claim of welfare for the purposes of this paper. The financing cost results are striking enough. But we 


%The panel labeled Forced Commitment in Figure \ref{reincidence} presents results of estimating equation (\ref{basic_reg}) with the dependent variable being a dummy for the client being a repeat customer. We define a client as a repeat customer if, after experiencing at least 75 days of the respective treatment arm, she came back and pawned a \textit{different} piece.\footnote{Results are robust to using number of days experiencing the contract larger than 75. We know it is a different piece from it having a different weight/value.}  The leftmost coefficient shows that the causal effect of the Forced Commitment contract on repeat pawning is an increase of 5 percentage points in the probability of being a repeat customer, this is twice the repeat purchasing happening in the status quo group. This effect is not explained by clients recovering their first pawn with higher probability in the Forced Commitment contract and re-pawning this same one since we make sure it is another piece; besides only 16\% recover their piece in the fist 75 days in the fee forcing contract. Experience with the frequent payment contract seems to be necessary as there is no effect of the monthly payment contract on repeat pawning in the first 30 or 60 days of the contract (see Figure \ref{reincidence_before} in the Appendix).

%\hl{The second coefficient from the left focuses on the subsample who are predicted would have a treatment effect on financial cost savings above the median} treatment effect in their first pawn.\footnote{Since this is predicted using \cite{atheygrf} based on pre-determined covariates for treatment and control clients it is valid to split the sample this way.} It shows that for these clients the likelihood of coming back is twice as large. That is, those that benefit more from the Forced Commitment contract are more likely to repeat compare to their control group. The remaining coefficients of the ``Forced Commitment'' panel condition on endogenous outcomes and should be interpreted with care. The \hl{third} coefficient from the left restricts the sample to those that had not recovered their pawn in the first 75 days in both groups and finds similar results. The \hl{fourth} coefficient conditions on clients who recovered their pawn of the experiment, again on in both arms. Results from these two endogenous samples are similar to those for the whole sample.

%The fourth coefficient \footnote{The second and third estimate must be interpreted with care as we are conditioning on a variable that may be affected by treatment. We view these 2 coefficients as suggestive correlations only. The fourth coefficient does not have that problem as it conditions on clients that by their pre-determined covariates are predicted to have above the median treatment effects (in both arms).} 

%The coefficient on repeat pawning is just as big when we focus only 2nd pawns happening after the first was recovered (third coefficient ``fnr'').  This is consistent with \cite{Laibson2018}'s conjecture that clients could be making decisions based on experienced utility.\footnote{The third coefficient conditions on the subsample that did recover their first pawn in both arms and finds a coefficient of 4pp. This is not a causal estimate as recovery is influenced by treatment, but we found it telling that the differences were similar to the causal estimate for the full sample.}

All of this evidence suggests that the effect on subsequent demand is `real' and not an artifact of improved retention of the collateral, consistent with \cite{Alcohol}'s conjecture that demand for commitment increases with experience with it. However, it remains possible that the additional demand for subsequent pawning comes from the fact that forcing earlier payments effectively reduces the credit available during the contract, and thus that clients may pawn again to compensate for the smaller loan. We are skeptical about this interpretation for several reasons. %First, typically the emergencies that trigger a pawn are short lived (e.g. needing to go to the hospital), and it is unclear why clients in the frequent payment arm wait for several months to re-pawn -- there is no effect of the monthly payment contract on repeat pawning in the first 30 or 60 days of the contract, (see Figure \ref{reincidence_before} in Appendix). 
First,  there are many alternative lenders in this market, and if they did not like frequent payments why do they come back to Lender $P$ for another loan? Second, the fee itself is mostly symbolic (2\% of 1/3 of the value of the loan) and so it is likely that if there were real financial costs to making an intermediate payment it would simply be skipped and the fee incurred.  We also implemented an exit survey which clients filled when recovering their piece. Unfortunately it had low response rate (7\%), and we take its results with a grain of salt; however in this survey 63\% of clients said they liked the frequent payment contract more than the status-quo one, and that it allowed them to avoid unnecessary expenses. Finally and most importantly, the treatment effects on re-pawning are entirely confined to the period after the original loan term and so there is no obvious link between intermediate liquidity and demand for new credit.  
%Third, we find larger effects of repeat buying for clients that experienced larger treatment effects, which the alternative explanation cannot explain. Fourth, the effect is present if we condition on clients that recovered their pawn (so it's not driven by pawn recovery). Finally, we were able to obtain observational data for all Lender $P$'s branches for the period January 2016 to May 2020, during which Lender $P$ expanded the new frequent payment contract. Using an instrumental variable strategy that exploits the expansion and availability of the frequent payment contract across branches, we show that being exposed to the frequent payment contract leads to an increase of 50 percentage points in the likelihood that in the subsequent pawn the frequent payment contract is chosen when both the status-quo one and the frequent payment contract are available (see \ref{appendix_b}). This choice cannot be explained by the need of another loan, since it is about \textit{which specific type} of loan the clients chooses conditional on getting one.


An additional empirical issue generated by repeat pawning is the question of how to handle the treatment status of those who take multiple loans within the experiment.  38\% of borrowers take more than one loan within the study period, and 19\% are assigned multiple treatment statuses on their different loans.  The issue of sequential endogenous treatments has been extensively studied in the context of school lotteries, where the convention is to use the treatment status from the first exposure \citep{cullen2006effect, abdulkadirouglu2011accountability}.\footnote{That context provides a particularly severe version of the endogenous re-entry problem because only the losers from initial lotteries re-enter subsequent ones.  Our selection problem is less draconian, but still potentially relevant since we do find treatment effects on pace of repayment and of pawning again.}  While our main impact tables simply use the assigned treatment status for every loan, in Table \ref{multiple_loans} we provide two straightforward robustness checks for the influence of this problem.  Columns 1-2 repeat the main analysis of financial cost and APR using the baseline approach from our main results, including dummies for the order of pawns for an individual, essentially making the identification within-order.  Columns 3-4 drop all loans other than the first, and Columns 5-6 pursue the ITT strategy of always assigning the first treatment status to all subsequent pawns. The core treatment effects are robust to any of these ways of handling repeat pawning, and the effect on the APR is actually larger when we consider first loans only.  Hence endogenous re-entry to the experiment does not appear to be driving our results.   


\subsection{Soft Commitment}

We now turn to the impact of the two arms that featured forms of `soft' commitment.  These results further reinforce the centrality of externally imposed commitment. 
Demand for the Soft Commitment contract  is higher than for the Forced Commitment contract by a factor of three: {31}\% of clients offered a choice between the status quo contract and the Soft Commitment contract chose commitment.  %Interestingly, the set of people who demand the Soft Commitment contract are different from those that demanded the Forced Commitment one. While in both cases the economically vulnerable demand less, in the case of the Soft Commitment those that we classify as present biased, those that report that they frequently fall into temptation buying, and those that ask for reminders of payment are \textit{less} likely to demand the Soft Commitment contract.  This suggests that those taking up the promise commitment are not the ones needing the commitment (see Figure \ref{interactions_takeup} in the Appendix). 
Nonetheless, we find Soft Commitment, whether chosen or induced, to be completely ineffective in this environment.  Table \ref{impact_soft} and  Figure \ref{effect_promises} finds that assigning clients to the choice-promise condition has a zero effect on financial cost, recovery, and the effective APR on average (Panel (a)), or on any sub-component of cost (Panel (b), and Tables \ref{table_robustness_fc_soft} and \ref{mechanisms_soft}). These results contrast sharply with the (lower-stakes, more short-term) evidence in laboratory experiments where promises have large effects on behavior. While clients are more enthusiastic about the Soft Commitment contract than the Forced Commitment one in the sense of tripling take-up, the promise contract provides no commitment. Results for the promise arms are consistent with \cite{Ted} and \cite{John} who find that people are likely to demand commitment when the commitment is too weak to have beneficial effects.  In short, not only is chosen hard commitment ineffective, but both forced and chosen soft commitment similarly fail to improve outcomes.  Only an externally imposed commitment product with reminders, imposed on people who would not have chosen it, decreases costs to borrowers.
   
%We see no difference even for the endogenous group that \textit{chose} to promise. This null effect happens not only on average, but also by percentiles (Figure \ref{qreg_chooser_nonchooser}, panels (c) \& (d)).
% There is also no effect on pawn recovery on (first coefficient in Figure \ref{fc_pro5}(b)), even for those that themselves choose to promise. And the null effect carries over if we use the definition of recovery in less than 120 days, or for the (endogenous) subgroups that paid a positive amount. Finally, there is no effect on repeat pawning (Figure \ref{reincidence}). 

%Giving choice of whether to promise or not has the advantage of making promising an active decision by the client. In most of the the experimental literature promising is voluntary. But it has the disadvantage that we cannot measure the causal effect of promising, since those that promise are a selected sample. To evaluate the causal effect of promising, we compare people allocated to the promise-forcing arm (were all clients were forced to make a promise) against those in the status quo contract arm. Figure \ref{fc_pro5} (c) and (d) show the results. It documents null average treatment effects for both financial cost and recovering the pawn. Also there is no effect on repeat pawning.

   
%\vspace{.2in}
%\noindent \textit{Size of ``mistakes''.} Although promises have very muted effects, there is some heterogeneity (see Figure \ref{heterogeneous_te_3}). This opens the space for choice mistakes. Figure \ref{choose_wrong} shows that indeed there are some mistakes, but these are smaller that for the Commitment Choice arm.  When $z=0$, we calculate that about 60\% of clients in the promise-choice group chose contracts that induced \textit{higher} financial cost. In particular gr{97\%} of those that chose the status-quo contract would have been better in the Soft Commitment contract, while gr{3\%} of those who chose the Soft Commitment contract would have been better in the status-quo one. On average they spend \$250 pesos on extra financing cost. 





\section{Exploring the Importance of Paternalism}
\label{exploring}

\todo[inline]{Issac: At different points in the paper we use different conventions for whether a positive treatment effect is ``good'' or ``bad.'' We should pick one and stick with it through to avoid confusion. (E.g. ToT/TuT tables treat positive as good but figure 15 treats negative as good.)}

\todo[inline]{Think more carefully about the ``mistake'' wording here. There's a difference between an ex-ante mistake and an ex-post mistake. Need to think more carefully about this. This also relates to the question about what information to use in the first machine learning exercise. I think if we use the $\text{ATE}(X)$ that's closer to an ex ante measure than if we use, say, $\mathbbm{E}[Y_1|X] - Y_0$.}

This is not the first paper to find low demand for commitment, however it is the first we know of that can compare choice versus forcing with a money-metric outcome such as loan repayment. As discussed above, a policy of forced commitment substantially lowers financial costs on average, both compared to a baseline no-commitment contract and a policy in which borrowers are free to choose their preferred contract. In spite of this, only 11\% of those in the choice arm choose commitment. In a world of heterogeneous treatment effects, this could nevertheless be consistent with individual rationality. So do the the other 89\% know something about their personal situations that we as researchers do not, or are most people in the choice arm making a costly mistake? We now present a range of econometric exercises that shed light on this question. Taken together, they cast considerable doubt on the notion of ``selection on gains,'' as embodied in the traditional Roy model. While we find evidence of substantial treatment effect heterogeneity, most borrowers would experience lower financial costs under a commitment contract. Indeed, leveraging a unique feature of our experimental design, we show that the average effect of commitment for the \emph{untreated}, those who would not voluntarily choose commitment, is large and negative. In an important sense the ``wrong'' people are choosing commitment.


\subsection{Potential Outcomes and Exclusion}

To interpret our evidence on the importance of paternalism presented below, it is important to be precise about the potential outcomes in our empirical setting. This requires introducing some notation. Let $Z_i \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ denote the treatment arm to which to participant $i$ was assigned: $Z_i = 0$ denotes the forced no-commitment arm, $Z_i = 1$ denotes the forced commitment arm, and $Z_i = 2$ denotes the choice arm. Now let $D_i$ be the treatment that participant $i$ actually \emph{received}, where $D_i = 0$ denotes no-commitment and $D_i = 1$ denotes commitment. By design, our experiment features perfect compliance in the $Z_i = 0$ and $Z_i = 1$ arms. It is only in the $Z_i = 2$ arm that participants are free to choose between alternative contracts. Let $C_i \in \{0, 1 \}$ denote a participant's ``choice type.'' If $C_i = 1$ then participant $i$ \emph{would choose commitment}, given the choice; if $C_i = 0$ she would not. Whereas a participant's choice type $C_i$ is only observed if she is allocated to the choice arm ($Z_i = 2$), her treatment $D_i$ and experimental arm $Z_i$ are always observed. Given the design of our experiment, these quantities are related by
\begin{equation}
D_i = \mathbbm{1}(Z_i \neq 2) Z_i + \mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 2) C_i.
\label{eq:potentialTreatments}
\end{equation}

We maintain the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) throughout. This means that participant $i$'s outcomes depend only on her \emph{own} values of $Z_i$ and $D_i$, not those of any other person in the experiment: there are no \emph{spillovers}. Under this assumption, a fully general model for the potential outcomes in our experiment would take the form $Y_i(d, z)$ for $d\in \{0,1\}$ and $z \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, allowing participant $i$'s potential outcome to depend \emph{both} on the treatment she actually receives, $D_i$, and the experimental arm to which she is assigned, $Z_i$. This model is too general, however, to allow us to explore the importance of paternalism. Accordingly, we impose the following standard exclusion restriction:
\begin{equation}
Y_i(d=0, z=0) = Y_i(d=0, z=2) \equiv Y_{i0}, \quad
Y_i(d=1, z=1) = Y_i(d=1, z=2) \equiv Y_{i1}.
\label{eq:exclusion}
\end{equation}
\Eqref{eq:exclusion} says that each participant's potential outcome is the same regardless of whether she \emph{chooses} a particular treatment $D=d$ or is \emph{assigned} the same treatment. Viewing $Z_i$ as an instrumental variable (IV) for the treatment $D_i$, this nothing more than the usual IV exclusion restriction.\footnote{\cite{chamberlain2011bayesian} uses an identical assumption to develop a theory of optimal treatment choice for an individual who has access to data from an RCT.} \Eqref{eq:exclusion} is plausible in our empirical setting and has testable implications that we fail to reject: see Appendix \todo{Fill in}{???} for details. Under \eqref{eq:exclusion}, each participant's observed outcome $Y_i$ is related to her potential outcomes $(Y_{i0}, Y_{i1})$ according to 
\todo[inline]{Issac: add a section \ref{bound_tot_tut_appendix} to the appendix and drop in the results for the Huber \& Mellace stuff; Frank: follow-up and draft that section of the appendix.}
\begin{equation}
    Y_i = \mathbbm{1}(Z_i =0) Y_{i0} + \mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 1)  Y_{i1}  + \mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 2) \left[(1 - C_i) Y_{i0} + C_i Y_{i1} \right].
\label{eq:potentialOutcomes}
\end{equation}

\Eqref{eq:potentialOutcomes} is the key to understanding the results that follows. By randomly assigning $Z_i=0$ and $Z_i = 1$, our experiment identifies the marginal distributions of $Y_{i0}$ and $Y_{i1}$ in the population as a whole. By randomly assigning $Z_i=2$, it likewise identifies the share of people with $C_i = 1$ (the treated), the distribution of $Y_{i1}$ for these individuals, and the distribution of $Y_{i0}$ for those with $C_i = 0$ (the untreated). Because $Z_i$ is assigned independently of pre-treatment covariates $X_i$, our design also identifies the corresponding \emph{conditional} distributions of $Y_{i0}$ and $Y_{i1}$ given $X_i$. These distributions are the ingredients that we use below to explore the importance of paternalism. 

%The fact that the Forced Commitment contract lowers financial costs for almost all clients, together with the fact that only 11\% choose it must mean that many consumers are choosing contracts with higher financial costs for themselves. We now use several different techniques to shed further light on the idea that the `wrong' people are choosing commitment.  

%Our core impacts show that forced commitment is uniquely effective, a result that can only arise if those who would not have freely chosen commitment benefit from it.  We now delve more deeply into this result.

\subsection{Treatment Effect Heterogeneity}
\todo[inline]{There's a connection between homogeneous treatment effects and predictability. In a homogeneous world, the treatment effect is perfectly predictable from the ATE.}

If the effect of commitment were homogeneous, there would be nothing more to say on the topic of paternalism. Our estimates of $\mathbbm{E}(Y_{i1} - Y_{i0}) = \mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i=1) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i=0)$ presented above are large and statistically significant. If $\Delta_i \equiv Y_{i1} - Y_{i0}$ were constant across $i$, this would be enough to conclude that the 89\% who do not choose commitment would have been better off if they had. As we now show, however, the effect of commitment varies considerably across individuals. Our approach relies on the following simple observation: if $\Delta_i$ is constant across $i$ then we must have 
\[
\text{ATE}(X_i) \equiv \mathbbm{E}[\Delta_i |X_i] = \mathbbm{E}[\Delta_i] \equiv \text{ATE}
\]
for any covariates $X_i$ that vary across $i$. If, on the other hand, $\text{ATE}(X_i)$ can be predicted using some scalar function $\tau(\cdot)$ of $X_i$, then the average treatment effect function is not constant so there must be treatment effect heterogeneity. 

We operationalize this idea using a two-step approach proposed by \cite{chernozhukov2018generic}.  We begin by randomly dividing the participants in the forced arms of the experiment ($Z_i \neq 2$) into two groups: a ``training set'' and a \todo{80/20 split?}{``test set.''} In the first step, we apply random forests to the training set to estimate two proxy predictors: $\psi(\cdot|\text{Training})$ approximates the untreated potential outcome function, $\mathbbm{E}[Y_{i0}|X_i] = \mathbbm{E}[Y_i|Z_i=0,X_i]$, while  $\tau(\cdot|\text{Training})$, approximates the average treatment effect function
\[
\text{ATE}(X_i) = \mathbbm{E}[Y_i|Z_i=1,X_i] - \mathbbm{E}[Y_i|Z_i=0, X_i].
\]
The proxy predictors need not be unbiased or even consistent estimators of the functions they aim to approximate: the goal of this exercise is merely to find a scalar function of $X_i$ that \emph{accurately predicts} $\text{ATE}(X_i)$.

In the second step we fit a linear regression model to data from the training set using regressors constructed from the proxy functions $\psi(\cdot|\text{Training})$ and $\tau(\cdot|\text{Training})$ constructed in the first step. In particular, we estimate 
\begin{equation}
Y_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \psi_i + \beta_1 (Z_i - \mathbbm{E}[Z_i]) + \beta_2 (Z_i - \mathbbm{E}[Z_i])(\tau_i - \mathbbm{E}[\tau_i]) + \epsilon_i
\label{eq:chernreg}
\end{equation}
where $\psi_i \equiv \psi(X_i|\text{Training})$ and $\tau_i \equiv \tau(X_i|\text{Training})$.\footnote{This is a slightly simpler regression than the one proposed in equation (3.1) of \cite{chernozhukov2018generic}, which involves propensity score weights. Because the random assignment of $Z$ in our experiment does \emph{not} condition on $X$, the propensity score weights in our case are constant over $X$ and hence drop out.} As shown by \cite{chernozhukov2018generic}, the coefficients $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ from \eqref{eq:chernreg} identify the \emph{best linear predictor} of the conditional ATE based on $\tau(\cdot|\text{Training})$, namely
\[
\beta_1 = \mathbbm{E}[\text{ATE}(X_i)] = \text{ATE}, \quad
\beta_2 = \frac{\text{Cov}[\text{ATE}(X_i), \tau_i]}{\text{Var}(\tau_i)}.
\]
If treatment effects are homogeneous we must have $\beta_2 = 0$. Rejecting this hypothesis establishes that $\tau_i$ predicts $\text{ATE}(X_i)$ and hence that $\Delta_i$ varies. Since $\tau_i$ and $\psi_i$ do not depend on the test set, inference for the regression in \eqref{eq:chernreg} is straightforward conditional on the Training/Test split.

\subsection{Bounding the Distribution of Treatment Effects}

As explained above, our experimental design identifies the marginal distributions of $Y_{i0}$ and $Y_{i1}$, call them $F_0$ and $F_1$. We can estimate them using the empirical CDF of $Y_i$ for $Z_i=0$ and $Z_i = 1$ respectively. Because we can never observe both treated and untreated potential outcomes for the same person, however, the distribution $F_\Delta$ of the individual treatment effects $\Delta_i \equiv Y_{i1} - Y_{i0}$ cannot be identified. It can, however, be bounded. \cite{fan2010sharp} show that the best possible pointwise bounds for $F_\Delta$ are given by $\underline{F}(\delta) \leq F_\Delta(\delta) \leq \overline{F}(\delta)$ where the bounding functions $\underline{F}$ and $\overline{F}$ are defined as 
\[
\underline{F}(\delta) \equiv \max \left\{0, \sup_y F_1(y) - F_0(y - \delta)  \right\}, \quad
\overline{F}(\delta) \equiv 1 + \min \left\{0, \inf_y F_1(y) - F_0(y-\delta) \right\}.
\]
These bounds are simple to compute, and can be surprisingly informative. Here we use them to bound the fraction of borrowers who benefit from commitment. Given the way that we have defined our outcome variables, this is the share of borrowers whose treatment effect is \emph{negative}, i.e.\ $F_\Delta(0)$. To construct the sharp bounds for this quantity, we simply substitute $\delta = 0$ into the preceding equations and estimate $F_0$ and $F_1$ using their empirical analogues constructed from the forced commitment and forced no-commitment arms of the experiment.

\todo[inline]{Issac: add in the confidence interval at $\delta = 0$ along with the figure \ref{fan_park_bounds}; Frank follow-up to add 1-2 sentences discussing the results. Presumably we find that $F_\Delta(0) > 0.11$ this means that at least some people who choose not to commit \emph{must} be making a mistake, although we don't know who they are and this doesn't tell us how large the mistake is.}

An alternative way of presenting the \cite{fan2010sharp} bounds is in terms of quantiles of the distribution of $\Delta$. Let $0 < q < 1$, and define $Q_0, Q_1, Q$ to be the quantile functions corresponding to $F_0, F_1$ and $F_\Delta$.\footnote{In other words, $Q_0(q) \equiv \inf \{x | F(x) \geq q\}$ and so on.} Then the sharp bound for $Q_\Delta(q)$ is given by $\underline{Q}(q) \leq Q(q) \leq \overline{Q}(q)$ where
\[
\overline{Q}(q) \equiv \inf_{u \in [q,1]} [Q_1(u) - Q_0(u - q)], \quad
\underline{Q}(q) \equiv \sup_{u\in [0,q]} [Q_1(u) - Q_0(1 + u - q)]
\]
By substituting $q = 0.11$, these expressions allow us to bound the 11th percentile of the distribution of $\Delta$. Under a stylized Roy model in which borrowers with the largest (negative) treatment effects choose commitment, $Q(0.11)$ equals the treatment effect for the borrower at the margin of indifference between choosing commitment. 

\todo[inline]{Issac: add the interval for $Q(0.11)$. Maybe we don't need a second figure with the confidence bands for the whole quantile function. (Overkill?) Frank: add a sentence or two discussing the results. Presumably the aforementioned quantile is indeed negative and fairly large.}

Taken together, these bounds suggest that at least some borrowers who would benefit from commitment do not choose it when offered. 

\subsection{Treatment on the Treated and Untreated}
In the preceding section, we used outcome data from the forced arms ($Z_i\neq 2$) along with the commitment take-up rate in the choice arm ($Z_i = 2$) to argue that at least some of the 89\% of participants who did \emph{not} choose commitment would have been better off if they had. By additionally examining \emph{outcome data} in the choice arm, it is possible to say more. We now show how our experimental design can be used to identify the average effect of commitment for both those who would choose it (the treated) and those who would not (the untreated). In particular, we identify the treatment on the treated (ToT) and treatment on the untreated (TuT) effects, defined as follows:
\[
\text{ToT} \equiv \mathbbm{E}(Y_{i1} - Y_{i0} | C_i = 1), \quad
\text{TuT} \equiv \mathbbm{E}(Y_{i1} - Y_{i0} | C_i = 0).
\]
The TuT and ToT effects are particularly interesting for understanding the importance of paternalism. If the TuT is positive, this means that someone who did not choose commitment would have been experienced a better outcome \emph{on average} if she had. In a canonical Roy model, the ToT should exceed both the TuT and average treatment effect (ATE). Because our design identifies all three quantities, it allows us to test this implication directly. If the ToT is statistically distinguishable from and substantially larger than the TuT, this provides empirical support for the relevance of selection-on-gains in real-world decision-making.

A number of recent papers compare estimates of the ToT and TuT to better understand who selects into treatment and why, e.g.\ \cite{cornelissen2018benefits} and \cite{Walters}. While valuable and interesting, this line of work relies, at least to some extent, upon structural modeling assumptions to extrapolate from the reduced-form quantities that are identified by the data alone to more interesting, and economically relevant, causal parameters.\footnote{While the marginal treatment effects (MTE) approach \citep{heckman2007econometric} can in principle be used to identify the ToT and TuT without parametric restrictions, doing so requires an instrumental variable $Z$ with sufficiently rich support that the probability of treatment take-up given $Z$ varies continuously between zero and one. In practice, instrumental variables are usually discrete and, even when continuous, typically have a more modest effect on take-up.} An alternative approach aims to avoid structural assumptions by calculating conditional local average treatment effects (LATE) given observed covariates $X$ and reweighting these according to the distribution of $X$ in some population of interest \citep{aronow2013beyond,angrist2013extrapolate}. For example, one might re-weight using the distribution of $X$ in the population as a whole, rather than the sub-population of compliers, to extrapolate from LATE to ATE. But you can't squeeze blood from a stone. This ``LATE-and-reweight'' approach relies upon assumptions of its own, most crucially the assumption that there is \emph{no selection-on-gains} conditional on $X$, i.e.\ that the conditional LATE equals the conditional ATE. As far as we are aware, ours is the only paper in the literature to identify the ToT and TuT without ruling out unobserved selection-on-gains or relying on additional structural modeling assumptions. This is possible because of the unique design of our experiment.

\todo[inline]{Presumably we want to say something about this design potentially being applicable to other settings?}

The key insight can be read directly from \eqref{eq:potentialTreatments} and \eqref{eq:potentialOutcomes}. Viewing $Z_i$ as an instrumental variable, our design can be interpreted as a \emph{pair} of RCTs, each subject to one-sided non-compliance.\footnote{For a full derivation, see Appendix ???.} The first of these compares $Z_i=0$ to $Z_i = 2$. For each individual with $Z_i = 0$ we have $D_i = 0$ and observe $Y_{i0}$. For those with $Z_i = 2$ we have $D_i = C_i$ and observe $(1 - C_i) Y_{i0} + C_i Y_{i1}$. This is identical to a ``randomized encouragement'' design in which treatment is only available to those who are encouraged: $Z_i = 2$. Under this interpretation, those with $C_i = 1$ are ``the compliers'' and it follows that 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i=2) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i =0)}{\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=2)-\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=0)} = 
\frac{\mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i=2) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i =0)}{\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=2)} = \mathbbm{E}(Y_{i1} - Y_{i0}|C_i = 1)
\label{eq:ToT}
\end{equation}
since $\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=0)=0$ by \eqref{eq:potentialTreatments}. 

A closely related if slightly less intuitive argument can be used to construct a Wald estimand that identifies the TuT. Here we consider $Z_i = 1$ to be the ``encouragement'' and compare the outcomes for these individuals to those with $Z_i = 2$. If $Z_i = 1$ then $D_i = 1$ and we observe $Y_{i1}$; If $Z_i = 2$ then $D_i = C_i$ and we observe $(1 - C_i) Y_{i0} + C_i Y_{i1}$. Again, we can view this as an experiment with one-sided non-compliance, but now the situation is reversed. Everyone with $Z_i = 1$ is treated, but some people with $Z_i = 2$ are ``always-takers'' who obtain the treatment ($D_i = 1$) despite having been allocated to the ``control'' arm $Z_i=2$. Under this interpretation, the ``compliers'' are those with $C_i = 0$: when $Z_i=1$ they take the treatment, and when $Z_i=2$, they do not. Thus, 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i=1) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i =2)}{\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=1)-\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=2)} = 
\frac{\mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i=1) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i =0)}{1 - \mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=2)} = \mathbbm{E}(Y_{i1} - Y_{i0} | C_i = 0)
\label{eq:TuT}
\end{equation}
since $\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i = 1)= 1$ by \eqref{eq:potentialTreatments}. 

\Eqref{eq:ToT} and \eqref{eq:TuT} are useful for understanding why our design identifies the ToT and TuT, but they are less convenient for estimation and inference. In Appendix \todo{Frank: fill in}{???}, we show that
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ToTreg}
Y_i &= \mathbbm{E}(Y_{i0}) + (\text{ATE}) \mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 1) + (\text{ToT}) \left[\mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 2) \times D_i\right] + U_i \\
\label{eq:TuTreg}
Y_i &= \mathbbm{E}(Y_{i1}) + (\text{ATE}) \left[ -\mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 0)\right] + (\text{TuT}) \left[ -\mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 2) \times (1 - D_i)\right] + V_i 
\end{align}
where the error terms $U_i$ and $V_i$ satisfy 
\[
\mathbbm{E}(V_i) = \mathbbm{E}(U_i) = \mathbbm{E}[U_i \mathbbm{1}(Z_i = z)] = \mathbbm{E}[V_i \mathbbm{1}(Z_i = z)] = 0, \quad z = 0, 1, 2.
\]
It follows that a pair of just-identified, linear instrumental variables regressions can be used to estimate and carry out inference for each of our quantities of interest. To identify the ATE and ToT, run IV on \eqref{eq:ToTreg} with instruments $\mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 1)$ and $\mathbbm{1}(Z_i=2)$. An F-test based on this regression can then be used to test the restriction $\text{ATE} = \text{ToT}$, and the usual IV output can be used to carry out inference for the ToT. No programming is required. Similarly, to identify the ATE and TuT run IV on \ref{eq:TuTreg} with instruments $\mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 0)$ and $\mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 2)$. An F-test based on this regression can then be used to test the restriction $\text{ATE} = \text{TuT}$, and the usual IV output can be used to carry out inference for the TuT. Again, no programming or special software is required. 

As explained above, a canonical Roy model would suggest that $\text{TuT} \leq \text{ATE} \leq \text{ToT}$. For this reason it is particularly interesting to consider inference for the \emph{difference} $(\text{ToT} - \text{TuT})$. The point estimate of this difference can be constructed directly from the results of the IV regressions described above. Because the respective estimates appear in different equations, however, a bit more work is required to obtain a standard error for $(\text{ToT} - \text{TuT})$. Define the shorthand
\[
p_0 \equiv \mathbbm{P}(Z_i=0), \quad p_1 \equiv \mathbbm{P}(Z_i = 1), \quad q_0 \equiv \mathbbm{E}[\mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 2)(1 - D_i)], \quad q_1 \equiv \mathbbm{E}[\mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 2) D_i].
\]
As shown in Appendix \todo{Frank: fill in}{???}, the asymptotic variance of $(\text{Tot} - \text{TuT})$ is given by
\[
\text{AVAR}(\text{ToT} - \text{TuT}) = \boldsymbol{\omega}' \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \boldsymbol{\omega}, \quad
\boldsymbol{\omega}' \equiv \displaystyle \begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{1}{q_1} & \frac{1}{q_0} & \left(\frac{p_1 - 1}{p_0q_1} - \frac{1}{q_0}\right) & -\frac{1}{q_1} - \frac{1 - p_0}{p_1 q_0}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
where $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is a covariance matrix that can be estimated from the residuals of \eqref{eq:ToTreg} and \eqref{eq:TuTreg}. Under iid observations,

%A unique feature of our design is the randomized assignment to treatment (forced commitment), control (forced no-commitment), and choice of treatment. 

%This structure allows us to observe the average value of both the treated and untreated potential outcomes, as well as the selection into treatment that would occur under choice.  A starting point for how to exploit this structure is to apply the logic usually used to estimate the Treatment on the Treated (ToT) to also recover the Treatment on the Untreated (TuT).  This approach assumes nothing about the decision to choose (other than random sampling generating counterfactual compliance rates that would have been the same in every arm), but imposes three exclusion restriction-style assumptions typical of Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) analysis.  Namely, a) the typical assumption that an individual not choosing the treatment has the same potential outcome as one not offered it, then b) the mirror image assumption for the Forcing arm that an individual forced to take Commitment has the same potential outcome as an individual freely choosing it, and c) no spillovers from chooser to non-choosers in the choice arm.\footnote{\hl{For robustness we also try a Manski-type monotone IV approach with similar results.}}


%More formally, let $Z_i$ be the observed, randomly assigned experimental allocation, where $Z_i=0$ denotes the control arm, $Z_i=1$ denotes the Forced arm, and $Z_i=2$ is the Choice arm.  Let $C_i$ be the choice type; $C_i=0$ when individual $i$ does not choose commitment and $C_i=1$ when chooses commitment, observed in the Choice arm and latent in the other two arms.  A fraction $p$ of individuals chooses the treatment in the Choice arm.  Finally, $D_i = Z_i\times \mathds{1}(Z_i\neq 2) + C_i\times \mathds{1}(Z_i=2)$ is the observed treatment indicator, and $Y(d,z)$ is the potential outcome function for $d=0,1$, and $z=0,1,2$.


%To test the difference between gains for choosers versus gains from non-choosers we need to identify $\mathbb{E}[Y_1-Y_0\;|\;C=1]$ (the Treatment on the Treated), and $\mathbb{E}[Y_1-Y_0\;|\;C=0]$ (the Treatment on the Untreated).   The observed outcome in the Choice arm is the weighted average of the treated and untreated outcomes; $p \times\mathbb{E}[Y_1\;|\;C=1] + (1-p)\times\mathbb{E}[Y_0\;|\;C=0]$.  Given assumptions a) and c) above we can recover the ToT from the difference between the Choice and Control arms as is standard, and then symmetrically we can invoke b) and c) to recover the TuT from the difference between the Forced and Choice arms as follows:

%\begin{align*}
%ToT \equiv \mathbb{E}[Y_1 - Y_0 \;\mid\; C=1]  &=   \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y \;\mid\; Z=2] - \mathbb{E}[Y \;\mid\; Z=0]}{p} \\
%TuT \equiv \mathbb{E}[Y_1 - Y_0 \;\mid \;C=0]  &=  \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y \;\mid\; Z=1] - \mathbb{E}[Y \;\mid\; Z=2]}{(1-p)} 
%\end{align*}


%This estimate of the ToT is the standard one that would result from instrumenting for compliance with the offering of treatment as in \cite{angrist1996identification}.  The TuT is the analogous estimator, which could be recovered in a regression pooling the forced and choice arms and instrumenting for \textit{not} complying with being assigned to the choice arm (for a more formal development, see the appendix).  The advantage of representing the estimands via division of the relevant ITT by the compliance (non-compliance) rate is that it allows us to estimate all the necessary terms from the single pooled regression Equation \ref{basic_reg}, from which the significance levels for the ToT, the TuT, and the difference between them can all be estimated as single-equation F-tests:


%\[ToT = \frac{\beta^C}{p}; \qquad\quad TuT = \frac{(\beta^F - \beta^C)}{(1-p)}; \qquad\quad (ToT-TuT) = \frac{\beta^C}{p}- \frac{(\beta^F - \beta^C)}{(1-p)}. \]

\todo[inline]{This next paragraph needs to be edited a bit. I think there's one more number that we need to put in the table of results: the SE for the ToT versus TuT?}

Table \ref{tot_tut} shows the results of this analysis.  Given that the ITT results for the Choice arm imply an insignificant worsening of outcomes relative to the control, our estimates of the Treatment on the Treated in the first row of the bottom panel show negative results that are larger in absolute magnitude (multiplied by ~9, the inverse of the compliance rate) and similarly insignificant.  The Treatment on the Untreated (TuT), conversely, is strongly positive across the board, and indicates a significant improvement for all outcomes (here ITTs are effectively multiplied by 1.12, the inverse of the non-compliance rate).  Most novel is the ability to form a test of the difference between the ToT and the TuT, which is conducted in the bottom rows of the table.  We provide four different ways of estimating p-values for this comparison; the standard clustered estimates motivated by the experimental design, normal and percentile bootstraps, and randomization inference.  The differences between treatment effects for compliers and non-compliers are of borderline significance in some of the unadjusted specifications, but are not significant once adjusted.\footnote{It is worth noting that the statistical power of these estimands is driven by the compliance rate; given our low overall compliance we are better powered to measure the TuT than the ToT, and the power for the difference between the two would be highest with a compliance rate of 50\%.}   Because of the large standard errors on the ToT coming from the low compliance rate in the Choice arm we are unable to state with statistical confidence that the TuT is higher than the ToT, but the TuT is strongly positive while the ToT is weakly negative, and so in both relative and absolute terms the choices being made are `wrong' relative to the potential outcomes.






\subsection{Quantile Treatment Effects}

\todo[inline]{Frank: cut this section.} 

We now want to move away from the experimental consideration of the arms as a whole, and dive into the individual heterogeneity to learn more about the relationship between choice and outcomes.  A simple way of interrogating the distribution of treatment effects is to use quantile regression. Figure \ref{qregs} plots treatment effects on financial cost and APR at the 15$^{th}$, 25$^{th}$, 50$^{th}$ 75$^{th}$, and 85$^{th}$ percentile of the outcome variables for the Forced and Choice arms.  It illustrates that a) there is substantial internal heterogeneity in the Forced arm, meaning that some people benefit from forcing and some do not, and that b) taken as a whole the Choice arm has no significant benefit in any part of the distribution.  Therefore, within the group being forced to take commitment we find large heterogeneity in the impacts.  

We can explore the heterogeneity within the Choice arm in a non-experimental but suggestive way by breaking apart the choosers and non-choosers and separately estimating quantile effects relative to the control for these two groups.  This analysis, shown in Figure \ref{qreg_chooser_nonchooser}, plots the quantile effects for the choosers only (circles), and non-choosers only (squares).  It shows two important features of the observed impacts.  First, the non-choosers in the choice arm never look different from the control, as should be the case if the exclusion restriction invoked in the prior section is true.  Second, all of the heterogeneity that exists within the Choice arm arises from within the Chooser group, and this heterogeneity looks qualitatively similar to (although smaller than) the heterogeneity observed in the Forced arm.  This analysis is observational because it splits the data on an endogenous variable (choice), but is nonetheless suggestive that substantial heterogeneity in treatment effects exists for all individuals exposed to the Commitment product, and that there are no obvious violations of the exclusion restrictions around forced versus chosen compliance.




%Benefits are distributed broadly however. Figure \ref{fc_pro2}(b) displays results from quantile regressions at the 15$^{th}$, 25$^{th}$, 50$^{th}$ 75$^{th}$, and 85$^{th}$ percentiles. All of them are negative. 
%This motivated us to implement a finer measure of treatment effects. 

%Figure \ref{fc_pro2}(c) plots the distribution of those treatment effects using this machine learning methodology. It shows that more than 70\% of clients experienced financial cost savings in the Forced Commitment group compared to the status-quo group. The causal cost savings are larger for the more economically vulnerable, %that report at baseline that they have problems paying for services like water, electricity and rent, 
%and those displaying overconfidence\footnote{see Section \ref{behavioral} for our measure of overconfidence.} about recovering their pawn, Figure \ref{HTE_fee_forcing}.
%those that have to incur in higher transport cost to go to the branch  and that asked to be sent reminders to pay, this later one being one proxy of being inattentive or sophisticated present-biased.






%Figure \ref{fc_pro4} digs in more detail into the sources of variation underlying the main effects in Figure \ref{main_te}.   $\beta$ coefficients and their 95\% confidence interval from estimating equation (\ref{basic_reg}) using different definitions of financial cost. The leftmost coefficient corresponds to plugging into the formula of section \ref{FC_def} the appraised gold value of the pawned piece. The second coefficient uses the subjective value of the pawn instead. In both cases we find that being assigned to the Forced Commitment commitment contract causes a large reduction in the financing cost the client incurred, of 9.4\% (\$297) under the first definition and 13.2\% (\$472) under the second one. That is, we find that \textit{charging} clients a late payment decreases total \textit{fee-inclusive} financing cost. 





%The hollow circles in Figure \ref{fc_pro4}(a) show zero average effects for the different definitions of financial cost analogous to the ones described above.   Figure \ref{fc_pro4}(b) shows further that the null effect happens for the 15$^{th}$, 25$^{th}$, 50$^{th}$ 75$^{th}$, and 85$^{th}$ percentiles.\footnote{The few clients that chose the Commitment contract (the solid black squares) do enjoy cost savings of 1005 MXN, which compares favorably to the 304 MXN in the Forced arm (as a fraction of the loan the numbers are 41.5\% and 12.5\%), but this combines the selection and treatment effects.} %Figure \ref{heterogeneous_te_4} plots the distribution of treatment effects and finds that the distribution offering choice actually \textit{increased} financial cost and default for about half of clients compared to being assigned the status-quo contract. Those tended to be the less economically vulnerable and more educated, {women}, and those whose family typically asks them for money.Figure \ref{fc_pro4}(c) finds null effects for pawn recovery. Consistent with these findings, Figure \ref{reincidence} finds no effect on repeat purchases for the Commitment Choice group. 




 %Figure \ref{fc_pro2}(d) plots estimated treatment effects of the Forced Commitment commitment contract with the dependent variable being an indicator of losing the pawn in less than 230 days. The leftmost coefficient shows that the Forced Commitment commitment contract increases the likelihood of recovering the pawn by 11 percentage points (26\% of mean recovery). This result stands in contrast with \cite{Pande} who find no effect of payment frequency on default in a group lending microfinance context. Figure \ref{fc_pro2}(e) shows the distribution of heterogeneous treatment effects for losing the pawn: The likelihood of losing the pawn decreases for 82\% of the population. %Figure \ref{HTE_fee_forcing}(b) in the Appendix shows that those we classify as present biased, those that requested to be sent a reminder to pay, and those who have more problems paying for basic services experienced the largest increases on pawn recovery.

\subsection{Relating Random Forest Impacts to Observed Choice}

\todo[inline]{Frank/Issac: need to discuss confidence interval construction for the mistakes exercise. I'm not 100\% sure about it. There's question of what we can actually infer from the random forest exercise. We can't learn the distribution of treatment effects within a ``bin'' but we can learn the ATE in the bin along with its standard error, and we can treat that as approximately normal. Another issue concerns whether we do or do not use the observed outcomes for the people in the choice arm. At present we're not using this. But you might say that we should. This would entail predicting their \emph{counterfactual} outcome. What I mean here is that $\text{ATE}(X)$ is what you would use to assign someone to a particular treatment, given that you have observed their $X$. But what we have is a little different. We observe both their $X$ and either $Y_1$ or $Y_0$. I think there's an interesting question here about whether we're interested in something \emph{ex ante} or \emph{ex post}. It relates to the issue of ``mistakes.'' We should discuss briefly as a group so Frank \& Issac can make the appropriate adjustments if needed.}

\todo[inline]{Issac: add in the picture for the ToT/TuT version of the ``mistakes'' exercise \& histograms of treatment effects by groups. We already have the histogram in figure 15 for the ATE. Is it possible to say something about the covariates of the choosers for whom we estimate a negative ToT?}

\todo[inline]{Frank draft: The first exercise looks at ``mistakes.'' These are defined by predicting treatment effects for the people in the \emph{choice} arm using their covariates. If the treatment effect is positive and they don't choose treatment, this is a mistake. If the treatment effect is negative and they choose treatment this is a mistake. There are two ways of carrying out this exercise. The first way assumes that, conditional on $X$, there is no selection on gains. This version uses a model of heterogeneous treatment effects estimated using only people from the forced arms to create predicted ATEs for people in the choice arm. The second version calculates ToT and TuT versions of the same thing, but this involves using data from the choice arm, so it's less efficient because sample-splitting is required so we have to discard some people from the choice arm when calculating ``mistakes.'' Issac implements this with 5 partitions of 20/80, repeating five times and averaging over the result. Comparing the results of the two versions we find something interesting. For the non-choosers, the results are similar in both versions. Lots of mistakes and pretty big. For the choosers, we find very little evidence of mistakes using the ATE version and much more using the ToT version. What does this mean? It suggests some form of perverse selection on gains. These must be people who think commitment will help them but it actually hurts them. Question: what are their covariates like? What kind of people are they? This gets to Craig's question about who is hurt in each treatment regime. There aren't very many choosers (only 11\%) and something between 15 and 35\%, depending on the threshold, of them are ``hurt'' according to our model. So quantitatively it's not many people. What about with the ATE: what fraction of people \emph{overall} do we predict are hurt by the treatment? (We bounded it above, but now we have a model.) Seems like this is around 1-2\%.} 

To more directly interrogate self-selection in this context, we would like to be able to relate \textit{individual} choices over commitment to the \textit{individual} counterfactual outcomes that borrowers would have realized in different states of nature.  To achieve this, we can use the honest causal forest method to impute borrower-specific treatment effects of the assignment to Commitment, and then map this estimate to the choices individuals make in the Choice arm.

Specifically, for each client in the choice arm we want to know how much cost savings would she have gained had she chosen the opposite contract. We do this in two steps.  First, we use  \cite{atheygrf}'s generalized random forests methodology to estimate the impact of the Forced arm relative to the control at the individual level.  The method generates a partition of the space of characteristics $X$, where each element of the partition is a leaf, and each leaf contains treatment and control clients with similar characteristics $x \in X$ which are used to calculate unbiased treatment effects for that leaf. The optimal partition is that which minimizes expected mean squared error of treatment effects predictions out-of-sample.  The tree is honest because it uses one sample to build the tree and another one to estimate treatment effects within that tree.  \cite{atheygrf} show that their treatment effects are asymptotically normal, which allows us to construct confidence intervals for our treatment estimate in each leaf. This method gives us the causal effect on financing cost of getting the Forced Commitment contract instead of the status quo contract for a client $i$ with characteristics $x_i$; call it $TE^{F}_{i}(x_i)$.   Figure \ref{heterogeneous_effects} presents the PDFs of the estimated individual-level treatment effects for our three main outcomes, showing the estimated effect as well as the distributions of the upper and lower bounds.  The figures illustrate the substantial impact of the Forced arm particularly on APR, for which more than 90\% of the individuals have positive treatment effects and even in the upper bound confidence interval more than half of individuals benefit.  

Then in step 2 we predict treatment effects for clients \textit{in the Choice arm} using the partition into leaves and the treatment effect from step 1, that is client $j$ is imputed the treatment effect of the leaf corresponding to her characteristics $x_j$. We call this counterfactual treatment effect $\widehat{TE}^{F}_{j}(x_j)$. This is precisely the counterfactual we wanted, because it lets us relate observed individual choices with estimated individual-level treatment effects.\footnote{This extrapolation of the treatment effects assumes that choice itself --conditional on a given contract-- does not affect behavior (note the evidence in the prior section suggesting this is the case).   Although the extrapolation is to another population, by randomization it is a statistically identical population with common support.} Armed with this, we say that a client made a ``mistake'' if either she chose the status quo contract and her $\widehat{TE}^{F}_{i}$ is negative (i.e. more cost saving from the Forced contract), or if she chose the Commitment contract and $\widehat{TE}^{F}_{i}$ is positive, (i.e.  financial costs are larger for the Commitment contract). When a client made a choice mistake, we say that its money-metric values is the absolute value of $|\widehat{TE}^{F}_{i}|$. 

%Using the forcing arms and extrapolating to the choice arms.
%Then, we predict these treatment effects for everybody in the choice arm using characteristics $x_i$. Let $\widehat{TE}^{fee}_{i}$ be the predicted financial cost savings for person $i$ of choosing the Forced Commitment contract rather than the status quo one, divided by the size of her loan (i.e. the negative value of the predicted treatment effect on financial cost for person $i$). $\widehat{TE}^{sq}_{i}$ is the analogous for the status quo contract. We define the choice of person $i$ to be a ``mistake'' if 

%\begin{equation}
% \{ i \; \text{chose} \; sq \; \text{and} \; \;  \widehat{TE}^{fee}_{i}>\widehat{TE}^{sq}_{i} + z \} \; \text{or} \; \{ i \; \text{chose} \; fee \; \text{and} \; \;  \widehat{TE}^{fee}_{i}<\widehat{TE}^{sq}_{i} - z \}
%\end{equation}

Since the prediction of the treatment effect is an estimate and has noise, we do two things. First, we normalize $\widehat{TE}^{F}_{i}$ by the value of the loan of person $i$ and introduce a threshold parameter $z$ and say that a choice is a ``mistake'' if the alternative contract would generate greater than $z$ in savings. We vary this threshold from 0\% to 15\% of the value of the loan. Second, we take into account uncertainty in estimation of treatment effects and report results using the extremes of the 95\% confidence interval bounds for $\widehat{TE}^{F}_{i}$.

Figure \ref{choose_wrong}(a) plots on the Y axis the fraction of clients that made a choice ``mistake'' and on the X axis the threshold $z$. When $z=0$, we calculate that about 82\% of clients in the Choice arm chose contracts that induced \textit{higher} financial cost. Most mistakes are failures to choose the fee-commitment contract ({97}\%), while only {4}\% of those who chose the fee-commitment contract would have been better in the status-quo one. The average mistake in pesos is \$250. %(90\% confidence interval [140,390]). 
As we increase the threshold on the size of the mistake necessary to be classified as having made the wrong choice, by definition the share in both groups falls, and among Choosers the number making an error falls quite quickly to zero.  However, the fraction of non-choosers making a mistake remains almost 20\% even at the highest threshold used (\$80 pesos), and panel b shows the \textcolor{red}{Complete this when understand figure}.  Panel C conducts a related but distinct exercise, showing the fraction of the entire control sample who would do better if assigned to the Forced arm; using the smallest threshold this fraction is over 95\%, showing that in this context there is an almost across-the board welfare benefit arising from this arm.  Since the only potential financial cost of the forced arm arises from individuals who would be induced to partially repay but then default anyways, this result suggests that very few such borrowers exist.



 

% Figure \ref{choose_wrong}(d) plots $\widehat{P(x_i)}$ on the X-axis, and the heterogeneous treatment effects we estimated in Section \ref{TE_fee-forcing} on the Y-axis. It plots a binscatter that splits the X-axis into 100 percentiles bins of predicted take-up probability and for each bin averages the financial cost treatment effects. If it was true that those with larger cost savings have larger demand for the fee-commitment contract, we would expect a negative slope (recall that more savings mean lower financial cost in the Y-axis). This is not what we find.  Using all clouds we estimate a slope close to zero in the relationship. Using the 80 right most points, we estimate a \textit{positive} relationship. A positive relation means that those more likely to demand commitment are also those that had smaller benefits from commitment. This result is similar to \cite{Walters}, who finds that students that select into more effective schools are the ones with smaller treatment effects from attending.\footnote{\cite{Walters} uses distance to school as an instrumental variable for choice, while we use randomization to choice vs no-choice groups as our empirical strategy.}



%The following text brought in from the prior ToT/TuT section; do we want to include?

%. Although the difference is not significant (Figure \ref{bootstrap_tot_tut}) since we have a low (15\%) compliance rate in the choice arm, which results in low power, we also estimate an Instrumental Random Forest following \cite{atheygrf}. The Instrumental Random Forest allows us to compute conditional heterogeneous treatment effects, which effectively lets us estimate for each individual with characteristics $X_i$ the quantities $ToT_i:=\mathbb{E}[Y_1-Y_0\; |\; T_i=1, X_i]$, and $TuT_i:=\mathbb{E}[Y_1-Y_0 \;|\; T_i=0, X_i]$. Figure \ref{tot_tut_ecdf} plots the ECDF for this quantities, together with the difference $ToT-TuT$. When testing for the difference in means between this two distributions we find a significant difference of \hl{0.03 points} at the 95\% level.



\subsection{Relating Choice Probabilities to Benefits}

   
The previous exercise consisted of extrapolating treatment effects from the no-choice arms to the Choice arm. Here we do the reverse. First, we estimate a flexible model of take-up of the commitment-fee contract \textit{in the Choice arm} using gradient boosting classification\footnote{Results are robust to other classification methods like Random Forest, SVM, etc.} and obtain for a client with characteristics $x_i$ a calibrated probability $P(x_i)$ of choosing the commitment contract. We then use this model to predict the counterfactual probability of a client with characteristics $x_j$ choosing the Commitment contract in the Forced arm if she had been given the choice, what we call $\widehat{P(x_j)}$.\footnote{Our gradient boosting take-up model has a good out-of-sample fit with an out-of-sample AUC of \colorbox{yellow}{0.85}. (accuracy 97\% in-sample and 90\% out-of-sample)} Now, armed with this propensity score in the Forced arm, we can ask whether people with larger Random Forest-estimated individual treatment effects (i.e. more cost savings) would have been more likely to choose it, as we would expect from a Roy model of treatment selection. 



We can represent the relationship between the HTEs from commitment and propensity scores in several ways.  Most straightforward is Figure \ref{HTE_vs_propensity}, which plots the individually-estimated treatment effect from Forced versus Control treatments on the Y-axis, and the predicted probability of choosing commitment on the x-axis.  The HTEs are very strongly downward-sloping over the part of the distribution that has heterogeneity in predicted propensities, the opposite of what we would expect from Roy-type selection.  The sample with the lowest propensity of choosing commitment has a smoothed benefit of roughly twice those with a .2 change of choosing, measured both in terms of benefit/cost and in terms of probability of repayment.  Hence the very large heterogeneous treatment effects are almost completely localized to the individuals who have the very lowest probability to select commitment.


Second, we can turn the continuous propensity score into a binary predicted choice, such that the proportion of choosers matches the observed data, and then compute cumulative distribution functions of the heterogeneous conditional average treatment effects we estimated using the Causal Random Forest. Figure \ref{benefit_vs_choice_cdf} shows there is a first order stochastic dominance in treatment effects between the two predicted categories. This means those more likely to demand commitment are also those that had smaller benefits from commitment.





Finally, a completely different approach to relating choice to HTEs arrives at a similar conclusion.  We attempt to characterize the class that benefits more from commitment using a finite mixture model with two latent types. After estimation of this FMM, we find that the class more benefited from being forced is negatively correlated with demand for commitment (see Figure \ref{fmm_hte} in the appendix). We identify this class with the naive individuals, since choice is the core divider, and this class is predicted to default more (see Table \ref{fmm_table} in the appendix). This exercise emphasizes how important choice is as a segregator.





Hence, we pursue several quite different techniques and all arrive at the same result.  All of the treatment heterogeneity is found among individuals who did receive the Commitment contract, whether chosen or forced.  Whether we exploit the point-identification of LATEs for compliers and non-compliers enabled by the Forcing arm, use HTEs to examine the `mistakes' made by choosers versus non-choosers in the Choice arm, estimate propensities and relate these to HTEs in the Forced arm, or use a non-parametric finite mixture model, the overall story is the same:  the wrong people are choosing commitment.


These findings suggest that forcing clients into commitment contacts may reduce financial cost for the overwhelming majority of clients. 
%Figure \ref{choose_wrong}(c) calculates what fraction of clients would be made better off if we forced them into the fee-commitment contract. We find that 85\% would be better off (using $z=0$), and they would on average have savings of 250MXN. 
This conclusion is in line with a recent paper by \cite{John}. In a savings context, she finds that when commitment is on the menu a majority of subjects wrongly choose too little commitment and fail to reach their savings goals. It is also in line with \cite{Sprenger} who show that the more naive about their present bias are the ones who demand less commitment.\footnote{This result is also similar to \cite{Walters}, who finds that students that select into more effective schools are the ones with smaller treatment effects from attending.  That paper uses distance to school as an instrumental variable for choice, while we use randomization to choice vs no-choice groups as our empirical strategy.}

%\subsubsection{Behavioral: overconfident borrowers demand less (but benefit more)} \label{behavioral}

The leading behavioral explanation in the literature for low demand for commitment is present biased preferences with naivete (e.g. \cite{Rabin2018}, \cite{John}, \cite{Laibson2018})  \cite{Laibson2015} shows that the lost flexibility resulting from a commitment contract can limit take-up especially severely when agents are (partially) naive about their self control problem. In our context if consumers are (partially) naive about their present bias, they would plan to save more (or spend less) than what they actually end up saving, thus making it be harder to recover their pawn. This under-saving will be mitigated in the fee forcing contract since the fee makes them save money to pay part of the loan periodically. \ref{appendix_c} formalizes this in a model. Another behavioral explanation is that clients may underestimate the likelihood and severity of negative income shocks. Both of these explanations predict that clients will be overconfident about their likelihood of pawn recovery. Recall that in the control group the client's subjective probability of recovery is on average 93\%, while actual recovery is just 44\%. A further piece of evidence consistent with underestimating negative income shocks and with present bias with partial naivete is that a large number of people (25\%) in the control group pay a positive amount toward pawn recovery but end up losing their pawn anyway.

So, overconfidence of recovering the pawn is implied by both present bias preferences with naivete and upward bias in their income expectations. But does overconfidence actually predict low demand for commitment empirically? It does. We define as overconfidence as the reported subjective probability of recovery minus the predicted probability based on the client's characteristics, $P^s_i-\widehat{P_i(X_i)}$.\footnote{We predict $\widehat{P_i(X_i)}$ in two steps. In step one we use Lasso with cross validation to tune the regularization parameter to select the most predictive variables $X$. The typical present bias question as in \cite{Ashraf} was eliminated in this step. In the second step we estimate $\widehat{P_i(X_i)}$ using those variables in a logit model. The Lasso selected variables were type of pawn, female, age, has pawned before, has savings, participates in rotating savings, often feels tempted to change plans, would like to have a reminder to pay, and an economic vulnerability index. We are careful not to include these variables as controls in Table  \ref{oc_reg}.} There is a large amount of overconfidence in our context. Figure \ref{oc_hist} plots a histogram of $OC_i$ and shows that the overwhelming majority display overconfidence, and a large fraction overestimate recovery by more than 50 percentage points. Our measure of overconfidence is useful especially when there is limited time for a detailed survey.\footnote{It may be more useful than a simple elicitation of present bias as in \cite{Ashraf}. We find that 15\% of clients are classified as present biased using this measure of preference reversal. This level is similar to the number \cite{Ashraf} find but small to explain no take-up of commitment for 90\% of clients. This measure was not correlated with take up of commitment in our sample.} First it is very prevalent, which makes it promising to explain the overwhelming prevalence of low take up. Second, it is easy to measure. Third, it is predictive of take-up in an intuitive way. Finally, overconfidence in recovery is implied by present bias with (partial) naivete but also by biased expectations of negative income shocks, thus capturing both kinds of bias.\footnote{\textcolor{red}{Another indication of overconfidence is that in our data, of those who renew, 83\% lose the pawn anyway. Our measure of overconfidence has a correlation of \hl{xxx}\% with a dummy for renewing and losing the pawn. }} 

\cite{Sprenger} have argued that it is critical to understand the link between beliefs and demand for commitment, yet the evidence is scarce. Table \ref{oc_reg} does this: it regresses an indicator of take up of the monthly payment contract against an indicator for overconfidence $OC_i:=\mathbbm{1}(P^s_i-\widehat{P_i(X_i)}>0)$ and controls. Controls $Z$ include branch and day of the week dummies, schooling, whether the client does a monthly budget plan, among others. We are careful not to include controls that were used in $\widehat{P_i(X_i)}$. % and a measure of intertemporal preference reversal analogous to that of \cite{Ashraf} as controls.\
In the choice-fee arm, being overconfident decreases the likelihood of demanding commitment by 12 percentage points a result that this is robust to including controls  (columns 1 and 2). While overconfidence predicts lower take up in the Commitment Choice arm, this is not the case in the promise-choice arm (columns 3 and 4).  One interpretation of the results is that the overconfident borrowers think they do not need commitment, and their demand decreases sharply as soon as there is even a small fee, and at the same time they perceive the promise as a low cost option. This provides evidence for \cite{Sprenger}'s conjecture that ``tepid demand for commitment outside controlled experimental settings is consistent with broad unawareness [of biases]''. 

How does overconfidence map to cost outcomes? Theory predicts that the more overconfident (naive) may be at the same time those that benefit more from commitment. Extrapolating individual treatment effects of the Forced Commitment contract vs the status quo one to the choice arm (see below for more detail), and using them as a dependent variable we find that overconfident borrowers benefit \textit{more} from the commitment contract, with {24.8}\% (=\${30}/\${121}) more savings (columns 5 and 6). Thus while we predict the overconfident benefit more from commitment, they demand less of it. 







\subsubsection{Neoclassical Alternatives} \label{neoclasical}

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Risk aversion.} We do not have measures of risk aversion in our short survey, which makes it hard to assess the hypothesis that risk aversion limits take-up of the fee frequent payment contract. One way to proceed is to take the empirical distribution of financing cost ---$F_{fee}(FC)$--- as one the client would have faced had she chosen the the fee-commitment contract. We could then ask what would risk aversion have to be in order to justify the client choosing the fee-commitment contract distribution of costs over the distribution associated with the status quo contract, $F_{sq}(FC)$. Framed as a choice among cost distributions, we can calculate what risk aversion is needed to rationalize the overwhelming choice of the status quo contract over the fee-commitment contract. This exercise of course assumes --as is common in economics-- that clients know the distribution of financial cost, that the distribution is common across consumers (although this can be relaxed), and that this cost distribution is the only difference among contracts. 

Fortunately for us, it turns out that one distribution first-order-stochastically dominates the other, obviating the need to calibrate a specific utility function or use a parametric distribution function in order to rank them in terms of expected utility. We use the fact that if the utility $u(FC)$ is decreasing in $FC$ (i.e. clients dislike paying higher financing cost) and $F_{fee}(FC) \geq F_{sq}(FC)$ for all $FC$, which we actually verify in our data, then $E_{fee}[u(FC)] \geq E_{sq}[u(FC)]$, that is any expected utility maximizing client risk averse consumer should choose the Forced Commitment contract as a result of the distribution of cost payoffs.\footnote{See the Appendix for the proof. Figure \ref{ecdf_fc} in the Appendix shows that indeed $F_{fee}(FC) \geq F_{sq}(FC)$. Table \ref{stochastic_dominance} shows that this holds also for sub-populations of different characteristics.}. Thus, risk aversion cannot explain the low demand for commitment under the assumptions of this exercise.   

%To have a benchmark we implement a very simple calibration exercise in two steps. First, we fit a Weibull distribution to the distribution of financing cost, were the scale and shape parameters depend on client's and loan observable characteristics. We do this separately for the status quo contract and the Forced Commitment contract, obtaining two distributions $f_{sq}(FC|X;\Gamma_1)$ and  $f_{fee}(FC|X;\Gamma_2)$ with different parameters $\Gamma_1$, $\Gamma_2$. Second, we assume a representative consumer with a CRRA utility function over financial cost, $u(FC)=\frac{1}{1-\theta}FC^{1-\theta}$. We then ask what would $\theta$ have to be for a consumer to prefer the status-quo contract. That is for which $\theta$'s would  $\int u(FC|\theta)f_{sq}(FC|X;\Gamma_1) dFC \geq \int u(FC|\theta)f_{fee}(FC|X;\Gamma_2) dFC $ hold? It turns out that it holds for risk aversion levels that are too high to be believable. That is, with our calibration, it seems unlikely that risk aversion is reducing demand for the Forced Commitment contract.


\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Lost flexibility.} A second explanation for low take up is lost flexibility. That is, the fee-commitment contract may provide too much commitment which is costly because the client may be forced to incur in late payment fees if he experiences a negative income shock.\footnote{Note that income shocks that affect the ability to pay the entire loan are a worry for both the Forced Commitment contract and the status quo one, and should not make one contract more favorable than the other.} While we cannot rule out that income shocks combined with lost flexibility of the contract explain the low demand, we think it is unlikely. First, we showed above that clients report a subjective probability of recovery of 93\% on average, which suggests they are not too worried about income shocks. Second, the fear of incurring fees is quantitatively not enough of a concern when compared to the savings they are experiencing. %Note that fees for late payment are not that high. In an average loan of 2,000 pesos the monthly payment is close to 700 pesos, and a fee of 2\% of that is 14 pesos (less than \$1 dollar). This is about gr{1\%} of monthly per capita income of the first 3 deciles of Mexican {household's} income distribution. %This compares favorably to the gr{\$11.6 + \$62.3)} pesos transportation / transaction cost of one. 

To make this concrete, we calculated what the financing cost of the fee-commitment contract would be if \textit{all} its clients incurred in \textit{all} potential fees (while keeping payment profiles and pawn recovery constant) and added these fictitious fees to financing cost for those in the Forced Commitment arm, thus artificially inflating their cost. We then re-estimated the quantile treatment effects analogous to Figure \ref{fc_pro2}(b) with this inflated financial cost. %\footnote{Of course behavior may not be constant, but we believe this is a reasonable fist approximation. %It could be that having this small fee added to the balance discourages them to pay or makes it harder to pay back the loan. But the contrary may also happen, with the fee making them more determined to pay early. We would need a structural model of client behavior to estimate a full counterfactual. We suspect that such small fees would not generate large changes in behavior in a simple neoclassical model.}). 
Figure \ref{fc_allfee} presents the results. We find that even in this extreme scenario, tilted against the Forced Commitment contract, the estimated effect still implies cost savings from the Forced Commitment contract at the mean, 25$^{th}$, 50$^{th}$, and 75$^{th}$ percentiles.\footnote{Recall that the differences in financing cost already takes into account the fact that clients in the fee forcing contract sink more pre-payments than those in the status quo contract, and that those prepayments are lost if the loan is not fully paid back.}  Although these arguments are not definitive, they suggest that low demand for commitment may be driven by more than the anticipation of lost flexibility implied by a small fee.

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{High time discounting.} We mentioned above that clients in the status quo contract tend to wait until the last moment to pay to recover their pawns. Even among those that recover their pawn, only 40\% pay before the 90$^{th}$ day. Table \ref{mechanisms} shows that clients assigned to the fee-commitment contract front load their payments, starting their first payment earlier and finishing paying earlier too. However, clients may dislike front loading payments if their time preference discount rate is high. They may be willing to trade off a higher probability of losing their pawn for more \textit{back} loaded payments.  

What would discount rates have to be in order for back loaded payments to offset the reductions in financial cost effects we observe? %We can calculate this number by looping across a grid of discount rates, incorporating this higher discount rate in the definition of financial cost, and reestimating equation \ref{basic_reg} with this modified financial cost measure as the dependent variable in equation 1, searching for the discount rate that makes $\beta$ equal zero. We did this and obtained 
We calculate that the discount rate that is necessary to compensate for the savings in financial cost (i.e. that makes the estimated $\beta$ in equation \ref{basic_reg} equal to zero when financing cost --using different $r$'s-- is the dependent variable) is a staggering 8,190 percent per year. We find this discount rate implausibly high even for this credit constrained population\footnote{For comparison, \cite{Levin} find that a discount rate of 1,415 per year for subprime borrowers in the US is too high to be believable.}, casting doubt on high discount rates as explanation for low demand for commitment. %\footnote{In the baseline survey we give respondents a hypothetical choice between $100$ pesos tomorrow or $150$ pesos in one month (an implicit yearly interest rate of {12,800\%}) and only 30\% chose the later one.} 

%\vspace{.2in}
%\noindent All in all, present bias with (partial) naivete is the more likely explanation for low commitment demand in our case. Moreover, Section \ref{model} shows that present bias with (partial) naivete is able to qualitatively explain all the main findings of the paper, not just low demand for commitment.







\section{Viewing the results through a simple model} \label{model}

\textcolor{red}{Need to decide Whether we keep this section or no.}

Although the empirical results are striking and stand alone, this section refers to the model of \cite{John} to interpret our empirical results. The model is stylized but incorporates important features of our context. It allows for negative income shocks which we think are prevalent in this population. %The shock generates a cost of committing to monthly payments and could potentially be a reason for low take up. 
It also features clients with present biased time preferences --allowing for partial naivete-- choosing to save to pay for an expense, and with the opportunity to make a commitment to save and pay. These two features parsimoniously explain several facts about the context --like overconfidence in recovering the pawn--, and about the results --e.g. that forcing commitment seems to help. We intend the model only as a very stylized approximation to our context, and we use it only to help us organize the interpretation of the empirical results, not as a literal description of reality. %Third, it allows for a simple way to model commitment afforded by late payment fees. %Nonetheless, the model abstracts from several details of the context. Even with these abstraction it allows us to explain our six main results listed in Section \ref{explanations_recap} below.

The model has three periods. In period $0$ the client is either allocated to the status quo, the Forced Commitment contract, or a choice between the two. In period  $1$ the client decides to save to pay the monthly installment or not save, and in period $2$ the client makes the payment to recover her pawn (or not). \ref{appendix_c} provides detail; here we just summarize results. The results have to be interpreted conditional on consumers going to Lender $P$'s branch to get a loan and being randomly allocated to the different contracts. %We do not model selection into pawnshop borrowing. 

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Result 1}: Present biased clients default more in the status quo contract.

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Result 2}: Imposing a fee  for late payments as in the frequent payment contract weakly decreases default (for present biased clients only), and strictly decreases default for a high enough fee. 

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Result 3}: Demand for commitment. Given a fee for late installment payment, (a) Neoclassical clients will never demand commitment; (b) Present-biased sophisticated clients will prefer the Forced Commitment contract over the status quo contract for intermediate values of present bias; (c) naive clients will demand commitment also for intermediate but different values of present bias, and depending on parameter values may demand less commitment than sophisticated clients.\footnote{Partially naive clients will on the one hand demand more commitment than sophisticated clients since they believe (incorrectly) that a smaller fee will motivate them to pay, while on the other hand they may demand less commitment since they think they can save and pay on their own. In the light of this model we seem to be finding that the latter effect dominates. %Whether they demand more or less than sophisticated clients depends on the empirical distribution of $\beta$ and $\hat{\beta}$. 
}

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Result 4}: Overconfidence. Only naive clients will be overconfident about the probability of recovery. This will be true whether they have the status quo or the Forced Commitment contract. Overconfidence is increasing in the degree of partial naivete.

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Result 5}: Welfare. (a) Neoclassical consumers' welfare strictly decreases when we force clients into the fee-commitment contract instead of the status quo contract, because we expose them to risk of them not being able to pay for the installment; and does not change when we offer them a choice between the contracts. (b) The welfare of sophisticated present biased consumers weakly increases when we give them choice, and it strictly increases  under intermediate values of present bias (when they would choose the fee-commitment contract themselves). Forcing them into the fee-commitment contract increases welfare only if they themselves would chose it. (c) Forcing can be welfare improving for the naive under some parameter values (see \ref{appendix_c}). 

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Result 6}: Welfare and ex-post observed behavior. Our finding that the Forced Commitment contract increases pawn recovery is ``a sign'' of higher welfare (although not a sufficient condition).


\subsection{Interpretation}

The model is very parsimonious but powerful and it can potentially explain all our empirical findings qualitatively.\footnote{The model is sufficiently stylized that we think we would not gain much from estimating it. Furthermore we have no data on income shocks which figure prominently in the model. \cite{Ted} and \cite{Aprajit} are two very recent models that combine a field experiment with commitment contracts and estimation of present bias parameters.} First, it can explain why default is high in the status-quo contract, namely that clients are present biased and have no commitment devices. Second, it can explain why clients are overconfident in our data, namely by virtue of naivete about present bias. Under the model naivete is necessary to explain this. Third, it can also explain why the fee forcing contract induces lower default, but not for everyone: namely that it makes the incentive compatibility constraint for payment binding for the present biased, while it was not binding in the status quo contract. Fourth, it can also explain why there is low demand for commitment even if it seems to improve welfare: namely that there is a small share of neoclassical and sophisticated clients, and at the same time naifs have a present biased parameters values in the region in which they think they can save on their own. Fifth, it explains non-zero demand for commitment for a set of clients. Sixth, it can explain why clients exposed to the Forced Commitment contract are more likely to come back namely those naifs whose welfare increased as a result of being forced into the fee-commitment contract.\footnote{Those with $\hat{\beta_i}>\beta_{SQ}>\beta$.}


\subsection{Other potential explanations: recap} \label{explanations_recap}

There may be other interpretations of the empirical findings, but the bar is high. An alternative explanation will need to explain the 6 facts below:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em 
\item High (although ex-post inefficient) default in status quo contract.
\item Overconfidence about pawn recovery.
\item Forcing commitment increases pawn recovery.
\item Small demand for commitment...
\item ...but positive demand for commitment.
\item Forcing commitment makes clients more likely to come back.
\end{enumerate}

Let us consider alternative explanations in isolation (i.e. just considering one change or feature at a time with respect to a neoclassical model):

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Alternative 1: Strong prevalence of income shocks.} This could explain (4) and (1), but not why forcing helps, (3) and (6), nor why there is overconfidence, (1). It would also not explain why clients come to pawn in the first place and then default, (2), as they would weight in on the high chance of losing the pawn. 

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Alternative 2: High time discounting}. This could not explain (1) nor (5) nor (6). It could qualitatively explain (4), but as we say in section \ref{sec:demand} quantitatively it would require unbelievably high discount rates.


\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Alternative 3: Risk aversion.} We already discussed and rejected risk aversion in section \ref{sec:demand}, although using strong assumptions in the process. Risk or ambiguity aversion could still play a role in explaining 4 and should be investigated in future research. However it would hardly explain (1), (2), (5), or (6).

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Alternative 4: Misunderstanding the contracts.}\footnote{This is a potential criticism of \textit{any} paper offering choice, and one that is non-falsifiable if the critic has free reign to propose how the contracts are perceived in the subject's mind.} We were very aware of the importance of clients understanding the contract in order to infer preferences from choice. That is why we made a strong effort for clients to understand the contracts (see subsection \ref{implementation}). Note however that while clients making purely random mistakes could explain why 10\% demand commitment ---i.e. (4) and (5)--- it would not explain the rest of the findings, nor why the Soft Commitment (see below) had more take up that the fee-commitment, or why we can statistically predict take-up with significant accuracy (see Figure \ref{interactions_takeup} and Table \ref{Table_compliance}).

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Alternative 5 (behavioral): Forgetting to pay/salience.} Frequent payments may act as a reminder to save and recover the pawn. This would try to explain (1) by appealing to people forgetting to pay, and (3), (5), and (6) by appealing to frequent payment acting as reminders (i.e. there being demand for reminders). It would not explain (2) or (4) which are critical in the paper. However even for (1) it seems to us a stretch to explain people losing a valuable pawn by forgetting to pay it. Since the Soft Commitment installment contract did not change behavior (as shown below) this explanation would also require us to posit that only fees acts as reminders, not promises.

\vspace{.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Alternative 6 (behavioral): Income shocks overconfidence}. One could also easily introduce in the overconfidence about income shocks in the model of \ref{appendix_c}\footnote{Say with $\widehat{\lambda} <\lambda$. The effect on demand for commitment is uncertain since on the one hand it decreases $\beta_{SQ}$ decreasing demand, but on the other a smaller $F$ is needed to make the IC binding, making commitment less costly.}. This would leave default unchanged in both the status quo and the fee forcing contract thus would not explain (3), %since $F_{min}(\beta,\widehat{\lambda})<F_{min}(\beta,\lambda)$. 
% $\widehat{\lambda} <\lambda$ alone 
It would not explain (5) or (6) either as demand for commitment would be zero without present bias. 


%\vspace{.1in}
%\noindent \textbf{Alternative 6: Learning that they are more present biased than they thought.} This is essentially the same as our proposed explanation (i.e. not an alternative) with the additional prediction that more people will demand commitment if they just experienced it, an specially appealing one in light of finding (6). We are sympathetic to the learning hypothesis and in fact it is \cite{Alcohol}'s main conjecture about why he finds strong demand for commitment while most other studies don't.\footnote{Close to ninety percent of our subjects claim to have pawned before. We find that experience does not predict positive take up in our sample correlationally.} To test it we would ideally need to give choice to a group of people that randomly experienced the fee-commitment vs those that did not, and test if the former demand it more. Unfortunately we did not do this experiment and we have very limited data to try it: {210 (6\%)} clients were given a choice in a second pawns in our experiment after being randomly assigned to the status quo or Forced Commitment contract. 
%\end{comment}


\vspace{.1in}
We do not claim that the model in the Appendix is the only possible explanation of our empirical findings, but it is a parsimonious explanation of all of them.



    
\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

In a pawnshop borrowing context, we study whether forcing borrowers into frequent payment commitment contracts reduces their borrowing costs, compared to a contract that does not provide commitment to pay monthly. Even though we are charging them fees, their borrowing costs are actually reduced by 9.4\%, and they recover their pawn with 26\% higher likelihood. Moreover they themselves seem to like this contract, as they are 100\% more likely to come back and pawn again when they get it. That is, commitment matters and it seems beneficial. Examining treatment heterogeneity we find that almost all clients benefit from the commitment contract. However when given choice between the commitment and the status quo contract only 10\% choose the former one and thus forgo important benefits. We also find that overconfident clients experience larger treatment effect cost savings from the commitment contract but at the same time have smaller demand for it. 

A simple model shows that present bias with naivete parsimoniously explains all findings. This suggests that it is possible in our context to advance an individual's interests by restricting her freedom of choice ---although we caution that our outcome measure focuses on financing cost and is not a comprehensive measure of welfare. These results spurred --although we cannot show they caused-- Lender $P$ to offer frequent payment contacts, although Lender $P$ was uncomfortable forcing these contracts on clients. They hoped that clients would eventually learn which contract was better for them.

Methodologically, to our knowledge this is the first paper in economics that uses machine learning methods and a combination of choice and forcing arms to estimate personalized counterfactual treatment gains to ask whether treatment take up is positively selected on benefits, a hypothesis we reject.

Pawnshop borrowing may attract particularly unsophisticated clients and freedom of choice may fare better in other contexts. Choice may also fare better with other contracts besides the fee-commitment one we used. We experimented with a ``softer'' commitment contract in the form of a personal promise, and found that although Soft Commitment contracts do indeed elicit more interest they did not cause changes in behavior. 

Our results suggest several avenues for future research. First, it would be useful to tease out the roles played by naivete about self control problems and biased expectations about income shocks in driving low demand for commitment. Second, one could ask whether other types of contracts ---for instance those that provide some insurance against shocks---  induce larger demand and better performance than the ones we tried. Third, testing and quantifying selection to pawnshop lenders based on sophistication could be important for regulators. Fourth, collecting broader measures of welfare to use as outcomes --e.g. subjective well being and consumption-- would help to make broader claims about welfare than we can make in this paper. Finally, one would like to know which interventions could de-bias consumers, or whether learning alone would do the work.

\noindent This table presents balance tests for the administrative data (Panel A) and survey data for those that pawned (Panel B) and for all (Panel C). The first column ``Overall'' presents data for all arms together. The second column shows summary stats for one month before the experiment. The remaining columns present summary stats  for each arm separately. The last column shows the p-value of an F-test of the hypothesis that the mean across arms for that variable is the same across the 5 arms. Randomization was done at the branch-day level. By design the observations are not exactly equal across arms as we were more interested in detecting effects in the choice-fee arm and less so in the no-choice-promise. Loan amount is the peso amount given to the client; Monday is the fraction of loans given on a Monday; Number of branch-day pawns is the number of loans given in each arm per day per branch.  In Panel B: woman indicated whether the client is female, age of the client is measured in years; has pawned before is a dummy=1 if the client declares to have pawned before (although not necessarily with Lender $P$). The subjective probability of recovery was elicited a la Manski, from 0 to 100 what is the probability that you will recoup your pawn. High-school is a dummy that indicates if the client has completed high school. Finally, the survey response rate is the percentage of clients in the admin data for whom we have a baseline survey. Panel C has the same variables, except for the last one. ``\% ended up pawning'' measures the fraction of those that answered the survey that ended up pawning that day in that branch.  P-values in Panel C test whether the 5 columns for treatment arms \textit{and} the column of pre-experiment have different means.

an OLS regression, and each panel represents a different treatment arm-control comparison.

The last row shows the mean of the dependent variable for the control group. Dependent variables are as follows: Column (1) measures the number of days elapsed from the pawning date to the first payment done. Column (2) records the number of payments done within 230 days of the pawn. Column (3) is the average size of the payments for each client in pesos. Column (4) is self-reported cost to get to the branch plus the imputed loss of a whole day of salary (using the minimum wage in Mexico) multiplied by the number of visits to the branch. Column (5) measures the number of days it took to recover the pawn, conditional on recovering. The dependent variable in Column (6) is a dummy =1 if the client paid any positive amount within 230 days of the pawn. For Columns (7) and (8) the dependent variable it is the sum of total payments done within 230 days of the pawn divided by the size of the loan, but column (8) includes as regressors a dummy=1 if the client recovered her pawn, and its interaction with treatment.

    This figure shows treatment effects using several measures of cost. The first definition is our main definition of cost, which uses the appraised value of the pawn. The second definition uses the subjective (self-reported) value for the pawn. The third and fourth definition adds the travel cost for the treatment arms. The last definition is a `fully adjusted' scenario that doesn't include the interest that is mechanically saved by paying early since this is the piece of the Forced-commitment contract that has a foregone liquidity cost for the borrower, on top of adding travel costs. We also compute APR versions of the above measures. 
    Finally, `APR - interests'  The treatment effects are indicated in standard deviations, together with 95\% confidence intervals.

        In Panel (a) we estimate what the treatment effect of the commitment contract \textit{would have been} for all subjects in the choice arm if they had been forced into the fee-commitment contract. To do this we proceed in two steps. First, we estimate treatment effects in the forcing arm by comparing the Forced Commitment arm against the status quo arm. We let these effects be heterogeneous as a function of our $x$'s using \cite{atheygrf}'s methodology of causal forests. Second, we extrapolate these treatment effects based on the choice arm using the same $x$'s. Once we have personalized counterfactual treatment effects in the choice arm we calculate what fraction of subjects in the choice arm incurred in financial costs that are  $> z$\% than if they had chosen the opposite contract of what they actually chose, were $z$\% is defined as a fraction of the loan. $z$\% is a level of tolerance we can vary and we plot it in the X-axis. The left Y-axis measures the fraction of subjects that would have been better by a margin of $z$\% if they changed their choice, and the right Y-axis measures the amount of money ``left on the table''. We use bootstrap to tighten the confidence intervals (CIs). \cite{atheygrf}'s heterogeneous treatment effect using GRF is asymptotically normal. We compute the HTE ($\mu$) together with standard errors ($\sigma$) . For every pledge, we draw a random effect from a normal distribution with parameters ($\mu$,$\sigma^2$), and compute via bootstrap the percentage that choose wrong, along normal-approximation CIs (results are robust if we use instead percentile CIs or bias-corrected CIs) . This allows us to estimate a distribution for the upper and lower bound CIs, which we then use to obtain a 95\% CI. Panel (b) is analogous to Panel (a) except that it does the exercise separately for clients we classified as overconfident ($OC_i:=\mathbbm{1}(P^s_i-\widehat{P_i(X_i)}>0))$ and those we classified as not overconfident. Panel (c) simulates what percentage would be better by at least $z$ if we forced everybody of those in the Commitment Choice arm into the fee-commitment contract.
        % Panel (d) asks whether it is the case that people with larger causal benefits from the Forced Commitment contract would be more likely to select that contract. To do this we proceed in two steps as well. First we estimate a flexible model of take-up of the fee commitment contract \textit{in the choice arm} using random forests, and from this model obtain a probability $P(x_i)$ of choosing the Forced Commitment contract for a client with characteristics $x_i$. We extrapolate this model to clients in the Forced Commitment arm to estimate what would they have chosen if we had given them choice. 
        % Figure (d) plots $\widehat{P(x_i)}$ in the X-axis using a binscatter that splits the X-axis in 100 percentile bins. The Y-axis plots the heterogeneous treatment effects of the fee forcing contract on the probability of losing the pawns (more negative means then more likely to recover it), averaged for the respective x-axis bin. Positive assortative selection would mean a negative relationship: those who benefit more by treatment and lose the pawn less are \emph{less} likely to choose it.  Using all bins we estimate a slope of zero in the relationship. Using the 80 right most points, we estimate a \textit{positive} relationship.

  %  Panels (a) and (b) in this figure show the estimated treatment effects of ``forcing'' the frequent payment commitment contract using promises, compared to the status-quo (control) for financial cost (Panel a), and for an indicator of losing the pawn (Panel b). Panels (c) and (d) are analogous but focus on the effect of giving choice between frequent payment commitment contract using promises and the status quo contract. In Panel (a) each dot represents the estimated treatment effect for a different definition of financing cost, or for a different sub-population, and its 95\% confidence interval. From left to right, the first effect corresponds to using the gold value of the pawned piece in the definition of financial cost and discounting the payments to present value using a 7\% monthly rate; the second uses the subjective value of the pawn; the third is analogous to the second but adds transaction cost (transport+1 day's wage) per visit; and the fourth conditions on the population that paid any positive amount towards recovery of their pawn. Panel (b) plots the effect of not recovering the pawn: the leftmost coefficients compares all those assigned to the promise-forcing arm vs all those in the status quo contract, where the dependent variable=1 if the client has not recovered the pawn 230 days after pawning. The next coefficient defines the dependent variable=1 if the client has not recovered the pawn 120 days after pawning. The third coefficient conditions on paying a positive amount, and the fourth conditions on paying at least 30\% of the loan.   Panels (b) and (c) measure the effect of being given \textit{choice} between the frequent payment commitment contract with promise and the status-quo contract, versus being \textit{``forced''} into the status-quo contract (control). Again it focuses our two main outcomes: financial cost and an indicator for losing the pawn. Circles present the treatment effects. The figures also presents differences in these two outcomes for those who chose the frequent payment commitment contract versus the whole control group (squares-NSQ), and also for those who chose the status quo contract versus the whole control group (triangles-SQ). That is: the squares and triangles combine selection and treatment effects.

% \noindent This figure shows the estimated treatment effect of ``forcing'' the frequent payment commitment contract using fees, compared to the status-quo (control). In Panel (a) each dot represents the estimated treatment effect for a different definition of financing cost, or for a different sub-population, and its 95\% confidence interval. From left to right, the first effect corresponds to using the gold value of the pawned piece in the definition of financial cost and discounting the payments to present value using a 7\% monthly rate - to the left we have a decomposition of the financial cost in its four components from left to right (1) Discounted payments to capital, (2) Payed fees, (3) Payed interest, (4) Cost of losing pawn; the second uses the subjective value of the pawn; the third is analogous to the second but adds transaction cost (transport+1 day's wage) per visit; the fourth conditions on the population that paid any positive amount towards recovery of their pawn; the fifth conditions on the sub-population of the treatment group that paid a fee and compares these to all the control group. Panel (b) plots the effects on different quantiles of the distribution of financial cost (using the first definition): 15th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 85th percentile. Panel (c) plots the distribution of the heterogeneous treatment effects on financial cost, estimated using \cite{atheygrf}. Panel (d) Measures the effect of treatment on the likelihood of losing their pawn. The first coefficient compares all the treatment group vs all the control using 230 days after pawning to define the dependent variable; the second defines it using 120 days. The third coefficient from the left conditions on the population that paid any positive amount towards recovery of their pawn (which in theory may be endogenous but empirically we showed not to be affected by treatment). Finally, Panel (e) shows the distribution of heterogeneous treatment effects of the probability of losing the pawn. % the effect on ``repeat purchase''. That is likelihood of doing an additional pawn (in treatment vs control) after having been subjected to treatment for at least 75 days. The second coefficient estimates the regression conditional on recovering the pawn {in both treatment and control}, and the rightmost coefficient compares those above the median treatment effect in financial cost savings, {versus all the control group.}

     \scriptsize This figure shows the estimated effects on repeat purchasing of the four treatment arms (Forced Commitment, choice-fee, fee-promise, choice-promise) compared to the status-quo control group. It shows robustness of the effects by focusing on different sub-populations. The leftmost coefficient compares all the Forced Commitment group against all status quo group. The second coefficient conditions on the first pawn not being recovered when the second was pawned. The third coefficient conditions on clients who pawned again after having recovered the pawn in the experiment. The fourth coefficient uses all clients (in both the Forced Commitment and the status-quo arms) who had an estimated heterogeneous treatment effect above the median. Conditioning on this set keeps the sample balanced across arms and therefore still allows for a causal interpretation. For the choice arm we present three coefficients: coefficients represented by a circle compare all those offered choice to all those in the status quo arm, thus estimating a causal effect. Coefficients in triangles and squares represent those that self-select into the fee or promise arms and compare this subset against the whole status quo arm. They therefore contain a selection effect together with the treatment effect and cannot be interpreted causally.

%     In the baseline survey at the branch, before the client knew the contract or had the pawn appraised, they were asked from 0 to 100, how likely it was that they would be able to recover their pawn if pawned. We generate a variable we call overconfidence (OC) defined as the reported subjective probability of recovery minus the predicted probability ($P^s_i-\widehat{P_i(X_i)}$). We predict $\widehat{P_i(X_i)}$ using LASSO as explained in the text. This figure uses all observations for which we have data on $P^s_i$ and $X_i$ from the baseline survey.
