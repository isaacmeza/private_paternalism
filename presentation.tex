\section{Motivation}



\begin{frame}{Motivation: Private paternalism}
\begin{itemize}
    \vfill \item Many institutions —firms, schools, financial contracts— restrict choice using built-in commitment mechanisms which help workers, students, borrowers overcome self-control problems
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Loans with fixed repayment schemes, homework due dates, etc.
    \end{itemize}
    \vfill \pause\item At the same time these firms hide these forcing mechanisms and don’t market their commitment features, potentially because demand for them is low.
    \vfill  \item  Laibson (2018) argues that clients that benefit from commitment may underestimate its value, and that in such cases private paternalism (i.e. allocating them to commitment) could be beneficial.
    \vfill  \pause\item  \textbf{We study the (a) benefits of imposing a structured repayment contract on financing cost, (b) whether there is demand for such structure, and (c) whether non-takers of such a commitment product would benefit from taking it.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Context}
\begin{itemize}
    \vfill \item Pawn loans involve borrowers leaving valuable liquid assets as collateral in exchange for an immediate cash loan
    \vfill \pause \item The loan is overcollateralized (loan is 70\% of appraised value) and collateral is liquid.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The lender approves loans in a few minutes without income or credit history check $\rightarrow$ used for emergencies.
    \end{itemize}
  \vfill \pause \item Because the loan is overcollateralized and collateral is liquid, the lender may gain if the borrower defaults on the loan, especially if the borrower pays towards recovery on the way to default.
    \vfill \pause  \item Among those that lose their pawn (60\%), 48\% paid a positive amount towards its recovery and on average paid 42\% of loan.
    \vfill      \item This happens in spite (or because?) of 74\% of borrowers reporting a 100\% subjective probability recovery ex-ante. 
    %\vfill   \item 13\% of borrowers are classified as present biased using the simple standard question.
     \vfill \pause    \item In such an environment, one may ask if putting more structure/committment in payments may help borrowers recover their pawn.
     \vfill \pause    \item Not only that: Will the structure/commitment be demanded by all (or most) people who benefit?
        

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\section{Contribution}

\begin{frame}{Methodological Contribution}
\begin{itemize}
 %\vfill \item A context of particular interest to behavioral literature:  the demand for commitment in financial contracts (Laibson 1997, Bryan et al. 2010), and many more.
 
   \vfill   \item Key quantity in debate about paternalism:  impacts on those who wouldn't elect to take the program versus impacts on those that do.   \begin{itemize}
       \item Oreopoulos 2006: effect of mandatory high school laws.
       \item Fowlie et al. 2021: defaulting customers into variable electricity pricing.
   \end{itemize} 
   
   
   
   
   %How do treatment effects relate to selection?  
    
    %Broadly speaking there are two approaches: the structural approach and the reduced form approach.

    %The structural approach combines instruments with a generalized Roy model and uses behavioral and statistical restrictions to extrapolate the causal effects for different sub-populations
    
    
    %The structural approach allows both selection on unobservables and selection on gains at the cost of modeling these channels. In contrast, the reduced form approach assumes that there is no selection on gains after conditioning on a set of covariates 


    \vfill \item  Large literature TE heterogeneity: \begin{itemize}
        \item LATE-and-reweight:  Aronow \& Carnegie (2013); Angrist \& Fernandez Val (2013). \alert{Assume no selection on gains}
        \item Structurally model selection:  Walters (2018) \alert{Need their parametric models to be correct}.
        %TUT and ATE implied by LATE-and-re-weight differ sharply from his model-based estimates
        \item MTE: Heckman \& Vytlacil MTE; Cornelissen et. al. (2018). \alert{Need instrumental variable with rich support, and separability of observed and unobserved determinants of TE.}
        %\item Brinch et. al. (2017) - discrete $Z$ but under some additivity restrictions on the MTE curve
        %\item Mogstad, Santos \& Torgovitsky (2018) - No parametric form assumption on MTE curve but only partial identification.
    \end{itemize}

    \vfill \item Our ``Controlled Choice'' design point identifies a number of relevant TE with mild assumptions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Because we have two forcing-arms and a choice arm, we can use one IV to get at ToT, and a second IV to get at TuT.
    \end{itemize}
    
    
   \vfill  \item Consider winners and losers from paternalism.     

%   \vfill \pause  \item Three-arm design:  Control, Choice (voluntary takeup=ITT), Forcing (universal=ATE).  We illustrate how to use standard exclusion restrictions to point identify:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Treatment on the Treated (ToT) and 
%         \item Treatment on the Untreated (TUT), also
% 	\item Average Selection on Gains, Average Selection Bias, and Average Selection on Levels
%     \end{itemize}

\section{Design}


\begin{frame}{Pawn contract}
    \begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figuras/sq_contract.png}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Structured payments contract}
   \begin{itemize}
       \vfill \item We designed a new contract that is identical to the status quo contract except that it enhances the regularity and salience of payments as a way to encourage repayment.
         \begin{figure}[H]
    \label{ExplanatoryMaterial2}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{Figuras/fc_contract.png}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
       
   \end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Structured payments contract}
%   \begin{itemize}
     
%       \vfill\item The purpose of the small fee was to mainly to make the structured schedule salient, not to be a large disincentive to be late. 
%       \begin{itemize}
%           \item Transportation cost to go to the branch to pay is on the same order of magnitude as the fee in average.
%       \end{itemize}
%       \vfill\item  The empirical literature provides some guidance that such a contract may decrease default and elicit demand.
%       \begin{itemize}
%           \item Field \& Pande (2008) find null effects of payment frequency on loan default for group lending (but samples are small and there is almost no default in the control). 
    
%         \item  Bauer et al. (2012) estimate a positive correlation between measured present bias and selecting into microfinance, which they interpret as demand for structured payments.
%       \end{itemize}
       
%   \end{itemize}
    
% \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data}
\label{data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Administrative data: 1 month before and 8 months after the experiment ended
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unique identifier for each client and each pawn.
        \item Value of the item, money loaned (70\%), date of pawning
        \item For all payments: date and amounts
        \item Fees incurred
        \item Whether the client lost the pawn, renewed the contract
    \end{itemize} 

    \vfill \item Survey data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item During experiment, we asked clients to complete a 5-minute survey before going to the teller window to appraise their piece and before treatment status was known to them.
        \item Demographics, proxies for income/wealth, education, present-biased preferences, experience pawning, if family or friends commonly asked for money, cost of going to branch, the subjective probability of recovering, the subjective value, etc.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}    
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Main outcomes: financial cost and default}
\label{fc_outcome}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We are interested in measuring the financial cost of borrowing, which very saliently includes the cost of defaulting on the loan and losing the pawn.
    \item We will measure loan default using an indicator $\mathds{1}(\text{Default}_i)$, and the cost in pesos using the following definition that capture borrower outlays:
\end{itemize}

   \begin{equation*}
    \text{Financial Cost}_i =  \underbrace{\sum_t P^i_{it}}_{\text{Pay to Interest}} + \underbrace{\sum_t P^f_{it}}_{\text{Pay to Fees}}  + \mathds{1}(\text{Default}_i) \times \left[\text{(Appr. value - Loan Diff)}_i + \underbrace{\sum_t P^c_{it}}_{\text{Pay to Capital}} \right]
   \end{equation*}

\vspace{.2in}
\: \: \: \: APR: equivalent yearly interest generated by sum of payments:
   \begin{equation*}
    (\text{APR})_i =\left( 1 + \frac{\frac{\text{Financial Cost}_i}{\text{Loan Value}_i}}{\text{loan term}_i}\right)^{\text{loan term}_i}-1 
\end{equation*}

   \vspace{.2in}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We \alert{will not talk about welfare}, only financial cost.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Welfare would depend on reduced liquidity, anxiety from monthly payments, cost of going to branch, etc. We don't observe these.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}







\begin{frame}{Treatment arms}
\label{treatment_arms}
   \begin{itemize}
    \vfill \item Randomization at the branch-day level.  Analysis at the pawn level.
    \begin{itemize}
        \vfill \item Control arm (1770 obs)
       \vfill \item Forced Commitment arm (1954 obs)
       \vfill \item Choice Commitment arm (2580 obs)
    \end{itemize}
    \vfill \item The existence of a choice arm allows us not only to measure if there is demand for such a contract, but who demands it, not only in demographic terms, but in terms of potential treatment effects (which include unobservables).
   \vfill \item  This design is innovative and critical for our purposes, as it enables us to explore whether or not forcing people into a structured payment contract could be more beneficial than allowing choice for a significant fraction of them.

\begin{frame}{Choice and Heterogeneous Treatment Effects}
\label{choice_hte}
    \begin{itemize}
    \vfill \item  So, forcing commitment decreases APR dramatically. 
    
    \vfill \item \textbf{Low demand:} In spite of this, given the opportunity, only 11\% of borrowers chose commitment.   
    \begin{itemize}
       \pause \item If the effect of commitment were homogeneous, this would be enough to conclude that the 89\% who did not choose it would have been financially better off if they had.
       \item However, we test and reject the null hypothesis of homogeneous treatment effects (Chernozhukov et. al. 2018).
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vfill \item The borrowers who did not choose commitment could simply be those who don’t need it?
    \pause \vfill \item The distribution of TE (i.e. $Y_{1i}-Y_{0i}$) is not identified, as one person is only observed in one treatment. However, it can be bounded using the two marginal dist $F_1$ and $F_0$.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item   We estimate the TuT conditional on $X_i=1$ or $X_i=1$ (say $X_i= PB_i$ or $=Confidence_i$) and see which sub-populations have larger TuT.

\vspace{.3in}
    \begin{align*}
        1=& \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y_{1i}-Y_{0i} | C_i=0, X_i=1]}{TuT}\Pr(X_i=1 | C_i=0) \\

\begin{frame}{Possible Behavioral explanations : TuT \& ToT by groups}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The TuT effect is concentrated on those that say they have 100\% of recovery. This is what we would expect if the Sure-confident don't demand because they think they don't need it (but are wrong).

    \item Test of homogeneity (Chernozhukov et. al. 2018) no longer rejected with `narrow'

        \includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{Figuras/wide_narrow_rule.pdf}
        \end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item   Even using the Random Forest to target, our four `narrow' variables only increase the fraction benefitting from 91\% (all Forced) to ~93\% (targeted).
    \item  Using a Logit with the `narrow' variables actually worsens performance relative to universal Forcing because Logit matches benefit/loss fraction, has both Type 1 and Type 2 errors.

\end{table} 
     

\begin{itemize}
    \item   As seen above, even RF with `narrow' variables results in very modest increase in targeting efficiency relative to universal paternalism.
    \item  Logit performs very poorly because it makes symmetric Type I and Type II errors and hence assigns many to control who would have been better off with commitment.
    \item  \textbf{Takeaway:}  In this context, with these variables, targeting paternalism relatively ineffective.

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
     \vfill \item Laibson has spoken of `veiled paternalism' in contexts where principals desire reliability; here we have a case of `veiled non-paternalism' where features encouraging default might be embedded.
     \vfill \item Novel design to study essential heterogeneity: ``Controlled Choice''
        %\begin{itemize}
         %   \item Combine ``Controlled Choice'' with MTE: Can we extend results of Mogstad et al (2017) to use our ATE, TUT, and TOT as additional inequality restrictions that constrain partial identification bounds for MTEs?
        %\end{itemize}
        \vfill \item  APR reduced by 34\% in the commitment arm
        \vfill  \item Results suggest selection on gains, but still large effects of imposing commitment on non-takers.
        \vfill \item Mystery of low take-up combined with large TuT seems best explained by sure-confidence among pawnshop customers.
        \vfill\item  Ability to target paternalism using objective covariates is poor; even using RF without cross-validation gains from targeting are small and with logit actually makes things worse.
        \vfill \item Suggests mandated commitment-based contract structures in payday/pawnshop loans as a form of pro-poor regulation?

\begin{frame}{Identification of treatment parameters}
\label{identification_randomized_choice}
\begin{equation*}
    Y_i = \mathbbm{1}(Z_i =0) Y_{i0} + \mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 1)  Y_{i1}  + \mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 2) \left[(1 - C_i) Y_{i0} + C_i Y_{i1} \right].
\label{eq:potentialOutcomes}
\end{equation*}

    Viewing $Z_i$ as an instrumental variable, the randomized choice design can be interpreted as a \emph{pair} of RCTs, each subject to one-sided non-compliance. \\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The first of these compares $Z_i=0$ to $Z_i = 2$.  This setting is identical to a ``randomized encouragement'' design in which treatment is only available to those who are encouraged: $Z_i = 2$. Under this interpretation, those with $C_i = 1$ are ``the compliers'' and it follows that 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i=2) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i =0)}{\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=2)-\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=0)}  = \mathbbm{E}(Y_{i1} - Y_{i0}|C_i = 1)
\label{eq:ToT}
\end{equation*}

\item The second considers $Z_i = 1$ to be the ``encouragement'' and compare the outcomes for these individuals to those with $Z_i = 2$.
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i=1) - \mathbbm{E}(Y_i|Z_i =2)}{\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=1)-\mathbbm{E}(D_i|Z_i=2)}  = \mathbbm{E}(Y_{i1} - Y_{i0} | C_i = 0)
\label{eq:TuT}
\end{equation*}


\item Because non-compliance is one-sided only, LATE=ToT in one case (since treated=compliers+always takers, but there are no always takers, as they cannot take without being assigned) and LATE=TuT in the other.

\begin{frame}{Honest Causal Tree construction}
\label{honest_causal_tree}
Given a dataset with an outcome $Y$, covariates $X$, and a randomized condition $T$ that takes on the value of 0 for control and 1 for treatment:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Split the data into subsample $I$ and subsample $J$

\item Train a decision tree on subsample $I$ predicting $Y$ from $X$, with the requirement that each terminal node has at least $k$ observations from each condition in subsample $J$

\item Apply the decision tree constructed on subsample $I$ to subsample $J$

\item At each terminal node, get the mean of predictions for the $T = 1$ cases from subsample $J$ and subtract the mean of predictions for the $T = 0$ cases from subsample $J$; the resulting difference is the estimated treatment effect.

\end{enumerate}

This is then applied to a causal random forest by using bagging or bootstrapping.
