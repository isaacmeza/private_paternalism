\begin{frame}{Pawnshop loans: prevalent and understudied}

\begin{itemize}
     \item Pawn loans are small, short-term loans, typically used for emergencies.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Used by borrowers who don't have much access to credit: no credit or income checks.
    \end{itemize}
    \vfill \item \textbf{Overcollateralized}. Those loans involve surrendering highly liquid collateral (gold), in return for an immediate loan of much smaller value.  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unlike mortgages, pawn lender retains the entire value of the collateral under default along with any payments.
        \item For a given loan, lenders earn more by default.
    \end{itemize}    
    \vfill \item Pawn lending is very prevalent in the world (Carter \& Skiba, 2012). 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 11,000 pawn shops in US, with 30m clients and \$14b revenues; in China \$43b.
        \item Our partner lender: 1m clients in 3 yrs (2.3m microfinance clients in Mexico, Pedroza, 2010).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}    

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Flexibility and high default}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Pawn loans are highly \textbf{flexible:} pay-when-you-want within 90 days, no structured payments, no reminders.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This lack of structure contrasts with microfinance loans.
        \end{itemize}
    \vfill \item High default rates, 44\% in our data (an order of magnitude larger than microfinance).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Subjective value higher than gold value $\Rightarrow$ inefficient to lose.
        \item Gold-buying stores (avg of 2.8) close to pawn shops (pay $\approx$ 100\% of its gold value).
    \end{itemize}
     \item \vfill \textbf{Optimistic borrowers}: In our data, borrowers are very optimistic about recovery: avg. subjective probability of recovery (0-100) in our data is 92\%.
     \begin{itemize}
         \item Conditional on default: more than 2/5 pay towards recovery (avg. 42\% loan value).
     \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Questions}
     \begin{enumerate}
         \item  Could borrowers benefit from \textbf{frequent payments}, but contract not be offered by lenders?
         \item \vfill If such a contract were offered, would it be demanded by borrowers?
        \item \vfill Would \textbf{mandating} frequent payments reduce financing costs more than giving a menu of \textbf{choices}?
        \item \vfill What is the treatment effect of frequent payments on those who would \textbf{not} choose them (TuT)? And, is there selection on gains for those choosing them?

\section{Context}

\begin{frame}{Status quo contract (control group)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Loan: 70\% of gold value in cash. Avg loan $\approx$ \$100USD.
    \item Loan term:  90 days.
    \item Repossession: if payments do not cover interest + capital, the lender sells the pawn at gold value.
    \item Interest rate: 7\% monthly rate on outstanding balances accumulated daily.
    \item No pre-payment penalties, no reminders.
    \item Borrowers can refinance the loan under the same terms if they pay incurred interest.
    \item Payments are first allocated to cover interest and lastly to capital.
    \item \alert{Pay when you want} before 90 days $\Leftarrow$ \pause We will impose ``Structured payments'' --- 3 equal-size payments per month.
\end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Administrative data} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1 month before, during, and 8 months after  experiment.
        \item Unique identifier for each client and each pawn.
        \item Value of the item, money loaned, date of pawning.
        \item For all payments: date,  amounts, and allocation to interest and capital.
        \item Fees incurred.
        \item Whether the client lost the pawn, recovered it, or refinanced the contract and when.
    \end{itemize} 

    \vfill \item \textbf{Survey data}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item During experiment, we asked clients to complete a 5-minute survey before going to the teller window to appraise their piece and before treatment status was known to them.
        \item Demographics, subjective probability of recovering, vulnerability, education, present-bias, experience pawning, cost of going to branch, the subjective value, etc.
        \item We use this data only in the last part to (a) estimate CATEs, (b) discuss some mechanisms.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}    
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Main outcomes: financial cost and default}
\label{fc_outcome}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We are interested in measuring the financial cost of borrowing, which includes the cost of losing the pawn.
    \vfill \item We will measure loan default using an indicator $\mathds{1}(\text{Default}_i)$, and the cost in pesos using the following definition that capture borrower outlays:    
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-.1in}

\begin{equation*}
  \text{Financial Cost}_i =
  \begin{cases}
    \sum_t P^{I}_{it} + \sum_t P^{F}_{it}   & \text{if } \mathds{1}\text{(Default)}_i=0\\
     \sum_t P^{I}_{it} + \sum_t P^{F}_{it} + \sum_t P^{C}_{it} + (\text{Value}_i - \text{Loan}_i) & \text{if } \mathds{1}\text{(Default)}_i=1 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

   % \begin{equation*}
   %  \text{Financial Cost}_i =  \underbrace{\sum_t P^i_{it}}_{\text{Pay to Interest}} + \underbrace{\sum_t P^f_{it}}_{\text{Pay to Fees}}  + \mathds{1}(\text{Default}_i) \times \left[(\text{Value}_i - \text{Loan}_i)+ \underbrace{\sum_t P^c_{it}}_{\text{Pay to Capital}} \right]
   % \end{equation*}

\vfill \begin{itemize}
    \item We also show results in APR-like ``effective'' yearly interest rate (norm. FC by loan value and term).
\end{itemize}

% \pause \vspace{.2in}
% \: \: \: \: APR: ``effective'' interest rate:
%    \begin{equation*}
%     (\text{APR})_i =\left( 1 + \frac{\frac{\text{Financial Cost}_i}{\text{Loan Value}_i}}{\text{loan term}_i}\right)^{\text{loan term}_i}-1 
% \end{equation*}

   \vspace{.1in}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We \alert{will not talk about welfare}, only financial cost.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Welfare could depend on reduced liquidity, anxiety from monthly payments, etc.
        \item If you have ideas on how to do welfare let me know.

\section{M-C design}



\begin{frame}{Mandates-Choice Design}
\label{treatment_arms}
   \begin{itemize}
    \vfill \item Randomization at the branch-day level.  Analysis at the pawn level.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \vfill \item Status quo contract (Control, 1770 obs)
       \vfill \item Structured payments (Frequent payments, 1954 obs)
       \vfill \item Choice between the two (2580 obs)
    \end{enumerate}
       \vfill \item  This design enables us to explore whether giving choice saves borrowers more money than assigning them to a Structured payment contract.
       \vfill \item The existence of a Choice arm allows us to measure if there is demand for such a contract. Will also allow more cool stuff... 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{More details on implementation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No person knew sequence of days-contract type.
        \item  Personnel were told that consecutive same contract-type could occur, and that randomization was happening in many if not all branches.
        \item We had materials to explain the contract in simple terms.
        \item Borrowers explained back the contract.
        \item Appraisers no incentive either way (paid flat wage). Enumerators were there every day all day.
        \item Virtually no borrower left the branch without pawning.
        \item They seem to like this lender: 87\% pawned there before.
        \item Stick to branch: we cannot find experimental subjects in 2 different experimental branches.

\begin{frame}{Identification afforded by experiment}
Our 3-arm experiment + exclusion restriction allows us to estimate: 
\begin {itemize}
 \item Treatment on the Treated (ToT).
 \item Treatment on the Untreated (TuT).
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.1in}
Notation: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Potential outcomes $(Y_0,Y_1,C)$, where $C$ is borrower's ``choice-type'' $\in\{0,1\}$, i.e. $\{SQ,Structure\}$
    \item Assignment: $Z \in \{0,1,2\}$, i.e. $\{SQ,Structure,Choice\}$.  
    \item Treatment: $D \in \{0,1\} $, i.e. $\{SQ,Structure\}$.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.1in}
Assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Z \perp (Y_0,Y_1,C)$, achieved by randomization
    \item $D = \mathbbm{1}(Z_i \neq 2) Z + \mathbbm{1}(Z_i=2) C$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{ToT and TuT are identified}
Exclusion restrictions (for a given person $i$):

\begin{center}
    $Y_i = \mathbbm{1}(Z_i =0) Y_{i0} + \mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 1)  Y_{i1}  + \mathbbm{1}(Z_i = 2) \left[(1 - C_i) Y_{i0} + C_i Y_{i1} \right]$

We have learned that:
\begin{itemize}
     \item Forcing Structure ATE > 0 $\Rightarrow$ leads to positive financial benefit. 
    \pause \vfill \item   Choice ATE = 0 $\Rightarrow$  giving choice does \textit{not} increase financial benefit. 
    \pause \vfill \item A large part of this is due to low demand for structure.
    \pause \vfill\item TuT>0 $\Rightarrow$ argument for compulsory treatment \alert{(paternalism)}
\end{itemize}
    \pause  \vfill Three obvious questions (evidence is weaker but suggestive here):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Why is demand ``low''?
        \item Would they learn over time that structure saves cost? 
        \item Can we target structure only to those that benefit instead of implementing a universal mandate?

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
     \item This paper analyzes the important but understudied industry of pawn loans, where over-collateralization and overconfidence may create a role for regulation.
     \vfill \item Simple change to contract terms results in substantial financial savings: mandatory structure lowers the APR from 57\% to 46\%, and reduces the fraction of borrowers who default by 6.6 pp.
    \vfill \item Novel RCT design to study take up and treatment heterogeneity (ToT, TuT, ASG): TuT>0, and no ASG. 
     \vfill \item Laibson has spoken of `\textit{private paternalism}', where firms supply commitment not demanded by consumers to the benefit of both. Pawn loans may be a contrary case, with lenders embedding features that \textit{hurt} borrowers.
     \vfill \item Q: (i) Would results hold using more comprehensive welfare measures? (ii) How would stronger lender competition affect the incentives to provide structured payment contracts? (iii) Would borrowers learn the benefits of structured payments in the longer run?
